Richard Baker,    13 hours ago,Just tried to pay for travel insurance online. Straight forward enough process. But  when I came to pay with my Visa Debit card their website just kept repeatedly saying &quot;no card number&quot;. In other words  after 5 attempts of reinserting my card details and their site deleting my card number  I gave up.No purchase for me. No sale to Aviva. What good is that? I sell for a living. Every sale is very important and great care should be taken with each sale. That is my attitude and how I make living. Clearly not so with Aviva.If they don&#39;t care about sales  the life blood of any company  then how much care will they give should I need to claim???No thanks. I&#39;ll take my hard earnt money elsewhere. When will you big corporates learn?
Antonio,    43 hours ago,The worst insurance company I´ve ever had.Had an incident with another vehicle who was escaping from the police in May 2016  and almost a year later they haven´t done anything despite me calling every month to ask about the status of the claim.And even they asked me to get all the details of the other vehicle via the police when the police told me clearly it was their job to contact them.But now that they have the details they tell me that the car did not have insurance and they can´t do anything again.Is this the promise they give to keep customers protected?  by not doing anything at all and keeping me busy calling every month and doing their work?.
harvey123,    3 days ago,Avoid this company at all cost for Private Medical Insurance cover. They will try and avoid paying out for treatment.  They spout Insurance jargon to you on the phone when you ring up  this is promptly covered by a long list of them informing you what you are not covered for.  They are happy to take your money and then will try and get out of paying for the treatment you need.  I have been with AVIVA for 15 years and never made a claim for myself. DO not get  private madical insurance with AVIVA.
Smiths52,    23 March 2017,I took out travel insurance with Aviva in January 2017 for a 3 week trip. The cost of the policy was £177. Unfortunately our trip was cancelled as the holiday property we rented was sold by the owner and the cottages company we rented it through could find no alternative. We had already paid for hotels and were due to lose approx. £1300 as a result. I contacted Aviva and told them I wanted to make a claim as in the policy it states that there is £5000 cover for cancelled or abandoned trips. Aviva said that the policy did not cover this situation and that I should pursue the owner of the holiday home directly. When I made it clear that I was astonished that we weren&#39;t covered I was told to check the &#39;wording&#39; of the policy. Not only was I dealt with in a dismissive manner  to add insult to injury I had also never received the detailed copy of the policy by post of electronically. Aviva told me that this was because I did not register with them  but I have been &#39;registered&#39; with their website for 5 years. Aviva have tried every trick to get out of paying this claim or accepting liability for a mis sold policy and I will be complaining to the ombudsmen. I did have a Life Insurance policy with Aviva but this has now been cancelled as can only imagine how awfully they would behave if I or a loved one had to make a life insurance claim. Awful company and awful experience.
Paul Stevens,    15 March 2017,29 minute wait to get through now they say I don&#39;t have a policy that I took out and paid for! CEO doesn&#39;t bother to respond to communication
Biff,    13 March 2017,Had health insurance from Aviva for 2 years. Only needed to make one claim and they tried everything to get out of paying. Then they sent a very snotty letter claiming I was trying to fraudulently make a claim  after they had given me the go ahead to have the operation. In the end I paid for the minor operation myself and have cancelled my health insurance with them.
Disgruntled customer,    11 March 2017,Have life and critical illness cover with Aviva for a few years. Have had 16 claim free years in total. Had heart attack  random event and had to be resuscitated. 9 months now with little contact unless I chase for it.  they have requested my entire medical history from my doctors and finally found a way of wriggling out of paying. Real scum of the earth snake oil salesmen. Promise if anything goes wrong you&#39;ll be ok. Then will find any way they can to leave you high and dry.  Last women I spoke to actually giggled when she told me they would not be paying honoring the contract.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. THEY EPITOMIZE THE INSURANCE COMPANY STEREOTYPE.
B Varsani,    04 March 2017,I had a motor incident and I was not informed or updated on the case. FIVE MONTHS LATER they decide to send me a letter telling me the outcome after I sent CCTV evidence. I made numerous phone calls too in this time and no-one felt the need to tell me what the outcome was. I am definitely not using this insurance provider ever again and informing all friends and family of this too as they cannot be the UK&#39;s number 1 largest insurance provider and they definitely are not &#39;committed to serving their customers&#39; (AVIVA  2017) if this is the type of service they are giving.
Shaw,    04 March 2017,The policy was set up on line easily but at renewal found it much cheaper to move to another insurance company as they had the same policy for much less. I phoned Aviva to cancel my renewal 4 weeks before the end of the policy and was unable to access my Aviva account online as I was locked out. This is totally wrong as I have paid for this service and should be available until the end of the policy in case I need to contact Aviva for a question claim or anything else.
Lauren Boe,    02 March 2017,My husband was in a car accident in December (not his fault  head on collision with someone under the influence)  they wrote his car off  it took a month for him to receive payment.They then wrote off the wrong car from our policy  and blamed my husband for not telling them!!! Hold on.....you had the car collected &amp; destroyed with out letting us know.They then cancelled our policy as they said that they had not been able to take payment from his account  this is a lie! My husband has a number of direct debits leaving his account every month and there hasn&#39;t been a problem with a single one of them. We called to discuss this with Aviva who said &#39;there&#39;s nothing we can do  we can&#39;t reinstate the policy  so it will cost you £150 to set up a new one. Don&#39;t bother with this company  they&#39;re absolutely useless!!!
Paul Beck,    26 February 2017,As an experienced insurance  proffessional I am appauled at the lack of knowledge and the amount of resistance to third parties making a claim  every stage has been unnecessarily difficult. My advisce to anyone having a not at fault claim is to employ a claims adjuster (not my line of work  i was in shipping insurance) who&#39;s costs will be bourne by the insurer. I tried to do it myself but met incompetence and resistance at every stage.
Grace,    24 February 2017,I was thoroughly impressed with Avivas service considering I&#39;m not actually a customer of theirs. My car was written off by an Aviva insured driver who admitted responsibility at the scene. Aviva were in touch straight away to sort out the issue arranging a hire car (which we politely declined) and arranging to send over 800 pounds to pay for the car. There was a minor issue with payment which I followed  up with a phone call and was easily rectified. Thought nothing of it then had a beautiful bunch of flowers delivered from them to apologise for the mix up! Again  excellent service considering I&#39;m not the policy holder - will be switching my car insurance to them! Thanks Guys
Timothy Hanson,    24 February 2017,They are useless and do not answer the phone.   I&#39;ve only given one star because you get offered a choice of hold music. Avoid at all costs.   Ive tried to call them several times now and after half an hour have had to give up.  Absolutely useless. happy to take the premiums but not to invest that money in staff to answer the phone.
Roderick Gray,    23 February 2017,I really like Aviva as they helped me all the way with my accident last week. And the settlement was quick too. Big thumbs up and keep doing the great work guys.
Michael,    23 February 2017,Awful company  one of their drivers hit my vehicles then sped off. Has been convinced in court and I&#39;m trying to speak to someone in Aviva regarding it. Keep getting transferred no one is able to help. 7 transfers and 50 minutes later I give up. Awful insurer.
jim melville,    09 February 2017,Had a leaflet dropped thro my door from Aviva 2car insurance from £169&quot; what a joke. filled in all the details to find they wanted £800+ on comparison websites it was only £300. KEEP WELL AWAY.
Alfons Goci,    09 February 2017,the worst customer service. i have complained and provided all the info they wanted and they didn&#39;t do anything about my complain. The complaint department is a nightmare. They told me they will contact me about a quote and i have two months waiting to hear from them.I have chased via emails but nobody wants to know. They have blocked my Plate number so i cannot buy online the insurance. I have escalated to my solicitor as I cannot deal with this companyWish you guys not to have an experience like mine.
N Butcher,    08 February 2017,Our car was written off 3 weeks ago still waiting for it to be paid our. not only that but the recovery company stole our dash cam and DVD players and Avivia will only pay £150 for these. They take too long and when you ring them its a constant move round the departments dreadful our car was written off as it skidded in the ice and ended up on its side so no chance it wasn&#39;t written off
Robert Wright,    08 February 2017,My 25 year old daughter had a minor traffic accident in snow and bumped her door and bumper in a spin and being fully comprehensive on her insurance she put in a claim for repairs.Imagine our disgust  at being informed she would not get the door repaired as they didn&#39;t believe it was done in the accident.For God&#39;s sake it was a spin in snow and she had to get out of the passenger side ...Anyway this is going to the omnibus man to decide ..thank God there is some recourse against insurers like Aviva  or we would all be paying there high premiums for a useless piece of paper ...
Pete Rabjohns,    27 January 2017,Trying to use the customer support to chase up a claim for car theft and it&#39;s a Joke. Transferred to different departments  transferred back  with noone wanting to take responsibility for the call. I can only assume that this is a business practice to put people of them. Wont be renewing with them.
Ian White,    27 January 2017,Made a claim on 1.1.2017?  the other motorist admitted it was his fault.  Got awarded 855. Aviva payed me 605.  They took 250 excess off it..  Still waiting for that back?? .  Not heard a thing off aviva???   tried to call them a few times?  Can not get any sencev out of anyone?  wasted lots of money calling them.  Only wanted an update on claim...?????
Sandra,    23 January 2017,Aviva are the worst company to deal with they will do everything to get out of paying I have never in my life been treated like this 7 years on after a gas explosion I have had to sell everything I could to fix my house no thanks to them. This has taken a toll on my health and my marriage  due to the stress of this I have had to live in this condition for the last 7 years and still have not got my home back to what it was it&#39;s disgraceful they way they treat people I am 67 years old this 7 years I will never get back  they no what to say and when to say it to get out of paying I have never had to deal with anything like this before if I could afford to take them to court I would every time I thought I was getting somewhere with the person that was dealing with my claim they ether left the company or were moved to different department ? the Ombudsman was of no help I was told not to go to the Ombudsman but I thought he would help me but this was a complete waist of time so if anyone knows of any help I can get I would be very grateful  as there is no way anyone should have to be treated like this they are a disgrace to there profession
Chris Brindle,    20 January 2017,Had a van insured by them smash into me. I have the footage  I have admittance of liability from the company director  I have their go ahead to pay out for my wingmirror then magically it changes story. Well the proof doesn&#39;t lie. Dash cam  recorded conversations and I&#39;m now out of pocket. Classic dodging tactics by a national company that doesn&#39;t want to pay out a £230 bill. Classy.
Ronald Beckett,    19 January 2017,AVIVA CAR INS. I been told thank you for full payments of my car ins so i carry driving my car thinking all ok. But 3 days later i have post come to me to say that they can not get full payments after 6 years with them. I went mad with them for letting me drive my car for 3 days with no car ins and then i have to sort it out and pay the full cost of my car ins again to get my car back on the road. Luckly i did not be stop by the police or crash my car god know what happen to this ins if that did happen. Well if that happen it down to the car ins for telling me thank for the full payments at frist time not at 2nd time.
Osman Cetindil,    18 January 2017,I am trying claim about my costs during holiday injuries while I was on holiday. But they trying make difficult and it is taking so long to get my money back. It is very bad service. Never bother again to do travel insurance from them.It was so easy to do insure but when I have problem I asked them first their authority and trusted them . Their customer advicer told me I can spend from my pocket and when I back I can claim all . But after different story. I am now planning to go to ombudsman service and after court after till end will fight with them.
Sonya Core,    05 January 2017,I was insured with Octagon. My renewal came from Aviva as they said Octagon was not doing insurance anymore.My new quote from Aviva came at £1000.00 more than the year before.I rang Aviva to question this and their response was that was the cheapest they could do. The lady was very unhelpful and sounded as if she couldn&#39;t care less.Never had a claim. We have over 14 years no claims.Told them to cancel it. The lady just replied fine.Got a quote with Axa for £400.00 with added extras  which is what we paid last year with Octagon.The quote from Aviva was £1489.00 with no added extras. Thought this was totally unacceptable and they could not give an explanation as to why it had increased so much.They were not bothered at all.
Nik,    04 January 2017,Thought I&#8217;d share my experience with Homeserve Plumbing and Drains CoverHomeserve is underwritten by Aviva Insurance  which also in my opinion brings concern with the regular home insurance and car insurance Aviva supply.In The summer of 2016 around 6:30am we had water dripping  then pouring through our light fitting in the bedroom onto the bed.I rushed into the loft to discover our 50 gallon cold water tank had developed a large vertical crack allowing water to gush out.  Upon closer inspection the whole tank was ready to give way as it had many white/stress lines all over it (to find out later it was totally brittle)I turned the cold water feed off to the house via the stop cock and called our plumbing and drains cover at Homeserve  after all this is what I was paying for  right?I told them the exact issue that the tank needed replacing as was split  this was verified that I said this in a playback of the recorded phone call   I also requested an electrician for obvious reasons that water had been leaking through my upstairs light fittings.Homeserve told me someone would be out between 8am and 1pm  after paying the £50 excess  considering it&#8217;s just before 7am now  it was lucky I could empty the tank and clear up all the water before it caused further damage while I was waiting for the engineer to turn up.I emptied the loft of boards and insulation and began drying out the plasterboard hoping to prevent too much further damage.  If I were unable to do this  say I was of the older generation  and stop the water coming in an ever filling 50 gallon tank I would hate to think of the damage it would have caused.The engineer (plumber  no sign of an electrician) came out at 12:45 so was lucky it was all drying out by then   the engineer came out  took a photo of the cracked tank and said I needed a plumber as I wasn&#8217;t covered  consistently scratching his head trying to decide what to do to make his visit worthwhile as he had already said I&#8217;d done everything he would have done.He eventually decided to put a stop tap to the feed of said tank so that we could have the cold water feed back on in the house  but no hot water. He then left.Then I phoned Homeserve back  in anger  to ask why this wasn&#8217;t fixed to which they replied they didn&#8217;t know the problem wasn&#8217;t covered until the engineer came out.  As said earlier I explained the plastic water tank had a split in it so needed a new one.  They replied that tank is not covered under my policy and they are a plaster fitting company that stops issues getting worse  and advise the correct professional to get out.  I asked for my excess back but was told no as the engineer did some work.Following on from this I am still trying to get my £50 excess returned  not because of the money  nor the fact that the engineer put a stop valve in  the reason being is the principle as if they had told me on my initial phone call that I wasn&#8217;t covered then the engineer wouldn&#8217;t have come out 6 hours later to find nothing need be done and would have made it less awkward for him trying to do something to make his visit worthwhile.I have contacted senior management and CEO&#8217;s of both Homesserve and Aviva as well as the financial ombudsman  of which felt my complaint wasn&#8217;t justified as it states in the terms and conditions of my policy that the replacement of the water tank was not included in my policy.I have since been told it is my responsibility to know all the terms and conditions of all my insurance policies so that something similar doesn&#8217;t happen again in the future.  Who knows ALL the terms and conditions of all their policies  especially in an emergency situation My argument there was surely the call handlers for Homeserve should also know their own terms and conditions and it would be easier to inform the customer that things weren&#8217;t included at the time of call and advise them to phone their house insurance  of which in hindsight I should have done but instead I phoned my plumbing and drainage policy providers as I deemed a severely leaking water tank in the loft was a plumbing emergency.I have tried to cancel my agreement since but have been told I would receive no refund as my policy was paid in full and a claim had been made  albeit this claim that I am disagreeing with.The responses from both Homeserve and Aviva are astonishing and their customer service can appear rude and intolerant.I am a landlord of a few properties that all require house insurance and plumbing cover and am always getting asked my recommendations of such firms from friends and colleagues.  My response to these people is to tell them my experience and say that I will not be using these 2 companies again so they can make their own mind up.So as to keep a customer happy for the sake of a £50 excess (and the principle)  they have lost all my business and that of others that I know.I have contacted RH CEOWho passed the issue to MBWho left it to GPG started off polite and trying to be helpful but has since become very rude in his responses  considering the customer is always right  he should always be polite  this he fails to do.I have some email responses from him  of which I will not post at this moment but let me assure you   they are not what you would expect from a Customer Advocate in what I assume is their head office.I have also contacted Aviva&#39;s CEOWho passed it down to SC who is a senior customer experience manager who must have gone to the same training school as the above GP.As I am still a paying customer until mid 2017 I feel it is very much within my rights to contact these companies on a regular basis to yet again ask for my excess to be returned  to bring my opinion back up on both companies  with the chance of future custom.Currently I just get a response that their response has been explained already and my email will be filed.I have said to both companies that I will be leaving my experience with Homeserve on a few review sites and Facebook so that others can see what Homeserve&#8217;s and Aviva&#8217;s customer experiences are like as you never know how good an insurance company is until you have to raise a claim.This review had been reported due to names of employees and the CEO being in it  so they have been removed.To be continued&#8230;&#8230;..
chris naylor,    03 January 2017,This is a company i would steer clear off they are not capable of telling you how they are investing your money or what percentage it has made year on year However they are good at sending out a standard letter telling you of a shortfall that may or may not happen  but not what they are doing about managing your account  in my case a £7000 shortfall.My advise keep away they are not to be trusted. C.N
John Harris,    03 January 2017,They take a months payment and charge a cancellation fee on top.I will not renew my car or house insurance with Aviva
Mr Benjamin Dyer,    28 December 2016,Has a two car discount with them and have been a customer with them for 3 years. But they really don&#39;t care about customers who are loyal and have not claimed with them  I for a fact have never claimed. But it went up last year a lot and expecting a better deal I was miffed when my renewal came in via email:  it has increased by £175.30 to £598.37. So I got onto them via the online chat with my mum and we questioned the severe increase hoping to get a clear reply and maybe they could quote me less or offer some discount but as you see the conversation wasn&#39;t what we expected and basically it is Aviva giving loyal customers the middle finger. So  be careful when dealing with Aviva as they clearly don&#39;t give a damn about loyalty or customer service... My advice is to avoid them if you can and find another insurer that won&#39;t exploit you with highway robbery to insure two older cars and will treat you with dignity and respect. Here is the actual conversation below make your own mind up info: at 16:09:39Your web support advisor today is Olivia  from the Aviva Live Chat teaminfo: at 16:09:39Welcome to Aviva&#39;s help and support web teamOlivia: at 16:09:44Hi Beryl Dyer  my name&#39;s Olivia. How may I help you today?Beryl Dyer: at 16:10:10Just had my new insurance renewal quote through and once again it has shot up. This time round it is £175.30 more than last year. Can you tell me why I have to pay this much on top even though I and my son have not claimed and we are supposed to be getting a 2 car discount? Last year it went up a lot but this year it is even worse and I think it is disgusting especially as we have been loyal customers.Olivia: at 16:12:07I am sorry to hear that you are now (not) happy with your renewal premium. Our premium&#39;s are calculated on many rating factors in which can make your premium increase or decrease  for example; if the area you live in has more claims within the last year  this will put up your premium. Unfortunately I cannot pin point one area in which as to why this has increased but I hope this helps clear up your question.Olivia: at 16:15:56I&#39;ve not heard from you for a few moments. Are you still with me?Beryl Dyer: at 16:16:00No  not really as you have failed to answer exactly why? Also I don&#39;t think you should charge us more for other peoples mistakes. You should be looking to keep our custom and not price us out of your insurance scheme. Can you make a note that I will not be renewing with you and kindly cancel my direct debit with yourselves and when our insurance expires kindly not renew it or charge us for the new policy as we have no choice but to go elsewhere.Olivia: at 16:18:22I unfortunately cannot give you exact reason as to why your premium has shot up  as I said above this is based on many factors. If you just bear with me for a couple of minutes and I will sort all of this for you please.Beryl Dyer: at 16:18:55I will wait for your reply thanksOlivia: at 16:20:39This is now cancelled for you. Please notify all drivers that they&#39;re no longer insured on any listed vehicle(s) from renewal. Details of the vehicle(s) removed will be passed to the Motor Insurance Database to show that Aviva is no longer insurer. The police check this database to reduce numbers of uninsured drivers. Please note it&#39;s an offence to use a motor vehicle on a public highway without adequate third party insurance. Please refer to your renewal notification for confirmation of your no claims discount entitlement.Beryl Dyer: at 16:21:43Is that cancelled effectively now or at the policy end of date?Olivia: at 16:22:17This is cancelled as of your renewal date of 23/01/2017. You are covered with us as until then Beryl.Olivia: at 16:23:01Your amended documents will be online within five minutes.Beryl Dyer: at 16:23:20Thank you and it is a shame that you advisers and the company you work for don&#39;t care about losing custom or treat us with respect. Thanks for your time BerylOlivia: at 16:24:12I am sorry that you feel this way Beryl. Thank you for your feedback  this will be taken on board.Olivia: at 16:24:21Have a nice evening.Olivia: at 16:24:22Thank you for chatting with me today. We&#39;d love to know what you think of our chat service.

Yaniv Halily,    20 December 2016,bad customer service  misleading and treating customers poorly. Stay away
Unhappy Customer,    13 December 2016,This is worth a read!I took out van insurance for the first year with Aviva  did not require anything from so they seemed fine  I came to renew  this took an age of online forms resulting in being asked to call them  which resulted in me being told to do it online for a discount which resulted in being told I can&#39;t be insured  yes after being insured for a year already! Another phone call and I was insured  finally!A requirement of no claims discount was demanded a few days later  another phone call from myself to point out they are the ones with my no claims bonus already!All sorted  well until I added an additional car to my policy  another demand of no claims bonus came  I called once again to point out they had it  then said I needed separate no claims bonus for this additional car  even though it&#39;s ONE policy  ONE driver who can only drive ONE vehicle at once!I explained I only have my one set of no claims bonus (14 years) and you already have that  the operator in the call centre said ok I will see what I can do and at that point her computer system &quot;was down&quot; and a promised call back would be within 30 minutes.Several days later a text message came demanding more money as the no claims bonus had not been provided!A scam  I thought  does a &quot;reputable&quot; company just text their clients demanding payment? Well yes apparently they do!The next text message came through stating my insurance had been cancelled  curious weather this was true I called Aviva directly  yes yet again I&#39;m calling them!What came next boils my blood even as I write this review.Yes my policy had been cancelled but not just the cover for the additional car (paid upfront in full) which they promised to call me back to sort out the no claims issue  but also the cover for my van which they had again full upfront payment and my 14 years no claims bonus!So they require separate no claims  separate payment  separate cover  separate renewal dates for seperate vehicles but are happy to cancel both together knowing full well the van needs to be insured!This gets better  I ask them to restart the policy as I need immediate cover and they said sorry we can&#39;t do that but we can start a new policy  I ask what the refund will be and they got all the figures wrong  and had the audacity to charge me cancellation fees and deduct cover given!They have made so any mistakes and when I asked about them calling me back apparently they had no record of that phone call  amazing how a company can behave in such a devious and criminal way is beyond me.I had to insure the van with them I was stuck without it  but the car is now with another company who were just less than half the price of Aviva  I don&#39;t mind paying more for a quality product or good service but you get neither with Aviva.I will never take any other products from them or any company they underwrite.I will never recommend them and will tell everybody I know and as many review sites as I can of this appalling experience.Please avoid at all costs  I&#39;m fairly switch on and they managed to scam me this way  it has cost me countless hours on the phone and their website  three months no claims bonus as that was lost when they &quot;had&quot; to start a new policy after they cancelled it and ££££&#39;s in cancellation fees and lost cover.Words can&#39;t describe how I feel and as soon as my van cover is up I shall be using another company for that too.I shall be making a formal complaint and reporting Aviva for this  I have no doubt they gave such horrendous service as they already had full payment from me and nothing to loose.Had they returned my call as they promised to the original issue none of this would have happened  had they simply had a fair and clear policy regarding no claims bonus none of this would have happened  had they simply called when they thought they required additional payment non of this would have happened  simple decency and courtesy would have solved this problem before it started.After my little disappointing and costly experience I took to the internet to see if I had been unlucky  no it appears that Aviva receive the most complaints and have extremely poor service across their entire range of products!Aviva hang your head in shame you won&#39;t last long providing a service such as this!
yasmine mahmoudieh,    10 December 2016,I had a non fault accident 10 weeks ago! Until today my car is not fixed and no one from Aviva can be reached!Absurd.This company has no right to exist and should be shut down!I have been given 5. Email addresses of supposedly responsible persons for the claim ! None of them ever responded to my mails! My car is still not fixed!Do not get insurance with them ever!
Chloe Jones,    07 December 2016,I took out a car insurance policy with Aviva last year. I ran a quote online including protection of my no claims bonus and pleased with the quote I received  I completed purchasing of the policy over the phone. I felt that Aviva had offered a good price and a good service. One year on however and I am extremely dissatisfied by the way Aviva has handled my policy. On looking to renew my policy I was informed that my no claims policy was not protected. Because a named driver on my policy had an accident what this means is that my insurance premiums are now so high I am no longer able to have a car. There is obviously a glitch in the system between the online quotes and finalising in person as I know I protected my no claims bonus and this is a big mistake on Aviva&#39;s part which has had a very negative impact. I have submitted a formal complaint but heard nothing back and am now without a car for me and my young child.
Steve Miller,    30 November 2016,I had to call the car insurance claims department twice recently.  The first time I had to wait for 40 mins  and the second time I waited for 50 mins !The service itself was also of second rate.  If the person who answered my first call had done his job properly  I wouldn&#39;t have needed to call the second time.  On the second call  the guy didn&#39;t know what to look up where and he had to transfer me to another person and I waited for another 30 mins (so 50 min + 30 mins in total) before I gave up and hung up.When the time comes around to renew my car insurance  I am moving onto another company.
Matt Conway,    23 November 2016,Got a new house and took the best insurance they had  covered for anything they said. Two weeks later had a leak in the shower put in my claim. Two weeks before another company came to look another week before I heard anything and that was only when I called. Refused claim said it was historical and accused me of neglect. Complaint on going but suspect that this will go to the ombudsman.Also sold my sick and very old parent a lifetime mortgage telling them it was equity release  after mum died they told dad  suffering from dementia that they now owned his house. He was so ill and died not long after.HSBC shame on you for recommending this company!
Mark Maguire,    22 November 2016,Tried a quote for three cars on aviva multi car policy. Noted they offered up to a third off. When I got my quote of £1300 I asked how much the multi car discount had saved me. The answer was £56!!! In my books that&#39;s around 4%. Way short of up to a third 33%. Technically correct but very misleading. How can you trust a company that is not open and transparent with their advertising?
Thomas Cowley,    20 November 2016,Failed to close a claim on driver&#39;s record due to internal processes  didn&#39;t mention it was left open  nearly cost us £500 and put our insurance on other vehicles at risk.Avoid at all costs.
Sue Stephens,    19 November 2016,I consider the Aviva boards decision to no longer issue dividend cheques leaves me exposed to fraudsters...not what I want from an insurance company. I will not be renewing with this company!!!!
Mícheál Patrick,    18 November 2016,Turned down my genuine travel insurance claim  got valuables stolen  wouldn&#39;t pay out and also wouldn&#39;t honour sickness part of their policy due to not enough evidence. (Even thought I had prescription and very clear a4 receipt with my condition on it). Was in Spanish speaking country was impossible to get this detailed letter they wanted retrospectively from a small independent clinic. AVOID!
Gaurav Karvir,    16 November 2016,Avoid!!! ..Son was not well.. Aviva said we cannot proceed with your claim as my child had symptoms of common cold.. seriously every child or adult has common cold i cannot just beleive they considered this as a pre historic symptoms for not processing the claim
Sarah Taylor,    14 November 2016,Completely disgusted by the &#8216;service&#8217; I have received. I had an accident nearly a year ago that I believed to be a scam against myself. A guy in the car next to me who saw everything and thought what happened was dodgy got out of his car  gave me his details and told me he was more than happy to stand as a witness. I gave Aviva his details and told them I wanted it looked into. I have heard nothing since and this was in January this year. No calls  no paper work  nothing. I assumed that Aviva had spoken to the witness and after speaking to him known that the situation wasn&#8217;t as it seems and everything had been dropped. Then when I go to insure my car today I find out that where I should have 2 years no claims discount  I have none. After calling Aviva to find out why  I have just found out that Aviva paid out to the other party therefore affecting my no claims discount. All of which I was completely unaware of. I was never contacted or given any paperwork to suggest that this would turn into a claim on my policy. I never had to fill out anything or sign anything. The last conversation I had about this was of January this year to give Aviva the witness details and to tell them I wanted the situation looked into as I believed it was a scam. The best bit is that the witness I gave was never contacted. Apparently you made a judgment call and didn&#8217;t call him  surely if I am paying for my own policy if I give you a witness and tell you I believe it to be a scam you would at the least contact the witness. Is this not what I pay for? After speaking to your so called manager who was rude and completely unhelpful I am then told there is nothing he can do and it will take up to 8 weeks for my complaint to go through the system. So in those 8 weeks am I meant to just sit around and have no car? I then asked for proof of the total amount paid out to the other insurance party  just an invoice or a receipt  something that proves you paid this money to them and surprise surprise you can&#8217;t give this to me. So although you have apparently paid out to this third party against my policy I&#8217;m not allowed proof of this!? I am absolutely appealed and disgusted by this and will be taking this matter higher and making s
Mr Chris Knight,    08 November 2016,Another rip off merchant!I&#39;ve had a year of multivariate insurance with Aviva. It&#39;s been fine  easy to make changes (although they like to charge you £20 for each change you make over the phone - like moving house or job). I haven&#39;t crashed so I don&#39;t know how they perform for claims. I was shocked though when I got my renewal notice - it had gone up by several hundred pounds. Bear in mind here - same address  job  car  parking situation but more no claims bonus. We have NO claims  NO points if anything it shod be cheaper. And it was!! With Admiral! £350 cheaper - more than 25% So I rang Aviva - convinced theyd made a mistake but was rudely told that was the best price and I could take it or leave it. I tried to ask why it had gone up but was talked over rudely by their staff who wouldn&#39;t even look at it. I think they&#39;re hoping to trick people into auto renewing which if you&#39;re older or struggle with internet access you may do. That should be a crime really. Anyway for these reasons I won&#39;t use Aviva again and I&#39;ll advise everyone I speak to not to either. And if anyone is considering renewing - shop around! Even comparison sites will beat it in under 5 mins!
Naomi,    03 November 2016,After experiencing two cheeky and rude call centre employees with serious attitude problems  we decided to cancel our healthcare plan. Despite many phone-calls and submitting a formal complaint it took several weeks for them to send us our certificates so we could go obtain cover from another provider. Their stalling tactics and false promises have definitely put us off ever using Aviva again. Do not recommend at all.
Christopher Baxter,    28 October 2016,Over the past year I have called at least six times and I love I always get a UK call centre.All issues resolved first time. Call centre staff knowledgeable and polite.I know there not the cheapest on the Market but  happy with the service I have received.
Breda Perrem,    27 October 2016,Accepted my car repair claim of 400 would be dealt with quickly - then downgraded it from 400 to 260. Three months and 10 phone calls later still not paid out. Staff indifferent bordering on rude. I&#39;m taking my complaint to the financial ombudsman. Possibly the worst company on the planet - fraudulent.
Dom Domski,    23 October 2016,I&#39;ve stared with life insurance with them   later my company set up pension plan . After bad experience with Tesco ( lost 2 yrs no claims after incident not on my fault ) and Admiral ( after selling my car they make me a problems to cancel my policy   booked black box instillation after my car was long time sold :-) . ) They give me 20% discount as existing customer   this become cheaper than any quote on comparison web sites ...With no claims and legal protection   breakdown cover over £150  cheaper than cheapest offer on compare the market from no name insurance companies ...Month later my home insurance was due renew so I have switched from axa to them also for a very good price .Not always comparison sites are giving You best deal   go direct and double check the offers from those . ITS WORTH.Regards Dom .
Elaine Collin,    20 October 2016,This was an on-going claim after renewal. Physio was needed for my daughter due to a flare-up &amp; after a 40 minute phone call &amp; 2 members of staff who knew nothing  I was put through to a Manager who said she needed to phone &amp; ask to be put through to &#39;Back To Better&#39;- operated by Nuffield Health. After a 30 minute phone call she was refused access to the scheme paid for in the policy  by an un-trained staff member. She could not speak to the physiotherapists for them to assess her  as the Manager said would happen.On phoning to complain the same Manager said she had listened to the call (in advance ??) &amp; agreed with him in refusing access. They are a very devious company. Anything not to pay out. I have taken this to the Ombudsman- the one allocated to look into this said he speaks to Aviva most days- that speaks volumes! I will not be re-newing with them  nor any other Aviva product. I do not like the ethos &amp; the spirit in which this company operates.
Letizia Schiavon,    20 October 2016,E&#39; una compagnia pessima!!!! Ce l&#39;ho da 6 mesi e mi son pentita! Ho fatto un sinistro (io ero ferma ad uno stop di sera  strada libera  son partita e ho preso una moto che procedeva senza fari) e mi han dato torto perchè &quot;a prescindere se ero ferma allo stop ho torto&quot;! Non hanno voluto sentire i testimoni  mi hanno richiamato dopo un mese a sinistro chiuso e solo perchè avrò fatto 100 telefonate. Mi hanno addirittura paragonato la moto ad un passeggino: &quot;anche il passeggino è senza fari  non per questo lo deve tirar sotto signora!&quot; Mi han trattata a pesci in faccia. Come si possa paragonare una moto che procede senza fari ad un passeggino io non lo so. Mi hanno pure derisa al telefono dicendomi che sono un&#39;ignorante perchè non conosco il codice della strada. Pessima pessima pessima!
Steven Langmaid,    18 October 2016,Had 15 years no claims bonus on my account  I made a unprotected claim being told I would lose 2 yrs no claims  but when my renewal came through I had lost 12 yrs  Aviva only honour the first 5 yrs! Not happy! Especially when I was told when claiming I would only lose 2. Never sent me the voucher they promised for a new child car seat either.
Robert Foggoa,    12 October 2016,I  had  a  car  accident  in January  2015  I am  still  waiting  for  this  low life  company  to pay  I was  involved  in  a  hit  can  run  they  didn&#39;t  fine  the  other  driver   This  low  discussing   doing  everything  not  to  pay  l call aviva  the  unless  person  on  the  phone  couldn&#39;t  understand  me  I been doing  this  for  a  year    Now  I   have  to  heir  a  lawyer  to go  after  them  I  will  win it just  going  to  take  a  while  My  a vice   to is   thinking  about  getting   ins  run  like  hell   from  aviva    you    don&#39;t  need   the  headaches   It&#39;s   a  sum  bag  company  Robert   foggoa
Blomer,    16 September 2016,Do not use Aviva for Health Cover  if anything happens to you they will not help you  even if you pay full cover for several years. Appaling customer service.
nikki watton,    04 September 2016,Been insured with them for the past year  asked them why my renewal was going up instead of down and then they decided they wouldn&#39;t renew the insurance and tried to make out it was because of what i was using it for?? it had been fine for the past year! Total joke! I will be cancelling all my policies with them!
Natalia Kouneli,    01 September 2016,I got a competitive quote from Aviva for car insurance last night. This morning I clicked on the &quot;buy now&quot; link on the quote email they sent me but I couldn&#39;t get through to the final payment step on their website. I called their customer service line and was told that I had been rejected but they wouldn&#39;t tell me the reason as they were not able to disclose that information. I am an experienced driver with 9 years of clean record so that leaves speechless.
Mr Baggott,    23 August 2016,My family were in the very unfortunate position that we were involved in a road traffic accident last week whereby we were hit from behind by another driver who totally admit responsibility.  At first I thought this was going to be very straight forward and the first thing we did was submit a claim form on line on the evening of the accident so that it would assist Aviva especially as when you call them they advise people to submit the claim on line so they have the full details to hand.The following morning I was expecting a phone call or even an email from email with regards my case but nothing apart from the automated reply email that came back to me when I submitted the claim form.The problems then started as soon as I tried to contact Aviva by phone in that they kept me hanging on the phone for about 36 minutes on the first occasion which I had to hang up in the end thinking no one was there at all and then the 2nd time a good 28 minutes went by.  Finally  I got through to some gentleman who basically had been placed on the phones with little or no knowledge at all on what to do or say with customers.  I was honestly put on hold a good 5 times where he had to go off and speak with his supervisor.  After now being on the phone for 56 minutes I asked a question about how soon I could get a courtesy car and then yes you guessed it &#39; I was put on hold again whilst he spoke with his supervisor as he didn&#39;t know what to do! &#39;.  By this time I had literally given up and told him that I would now like to make a formal complaint about the way my claim was being handled and to make sure it was logged on the system.  To my amazement as soon as I said this his supervisor came straight on the phone who apologized and told me that he was being trained up!Surely a professional company like Aviva must train their staff to a what I hope is a good basic standard before they are let loose on the telephones to customers.If all new employees have been trained to a what I call a reasonable standard then if I were Mark Wilson  ( Aviva&#39;s Chief Executive )  I would certainly be having extremely strong words with the head of personal for training and development there at Aviva.After reading all my comments you might be amazed at why I have given this review of Aviva 4 stars and not just 1?Well in the afternoon I gave Aviva yet another call ready and armed ready to speak to someone senior with the intention of making my complaint heard.  I then got through straight away to a lady called Gemma Britcher who I can honestly say has saved Aviva from not only losing a good customer.  The lady Gemma was not only highly professional she actually spoke and listened to me as if she was not reading from a written script and went above and beyond what I call good customer service.  I am not sure about the back ground or previous experience of this lady but again if I was Mark Wilson I would certainly not let her leave Aviva as companies like John Lewis would certainly employ her as one of their managers.  Gemma couldn&#39;t apologise enough to me and even took the time out to ask how my family were after the accident and treated me as if she was a family member not just another number on the system.If any Aviva customer is reading this review then I guarantee you if you are lucky enough to be put through to Gemma Britcher then be rest assured you are in the best possible hands.So please  Mr Wilson  if you should read this then please pass on my sincere thanks to Gemma as she certainly deserves recognition for her service to your company.Kind regardsMr S.Baggott ( Aviva Policy Holder )
David Wheeler,    22 August 2016,My house was broken into. My car and keys were stolen. Thankfully the Police caught the thief in days and he is now in prison. Aviva used every dirty trick possible to stall and reduce the insurance payment adding to the trauma of the incident.It took so long to settle that I complained and a Aviva complains handler advised me to go to the Ombudsman.Though they did pay out in the end my advice is DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
Tony,    19 August 2016,Can this be true? - I understand that due to a high level of complaints from Aviva policy holders regarding delays in receiving their pension pots  the Alpha Pensions Claim Team have recently been replaced by circus trained chimps who are working for peanuts as per NUT union rates.This move by the management was inspired by an earlier television advertising campaign for a famous tea brand  showing chimps holding cups of tea in a group  sitting around a table and gibbering away  making them ideal candidates for call centre work with Aviva.An insider did remark that the Alpha Pensions Claim Team had now swung from a group of zombie seat warmers to a vastly over qualified hairy workforce  which has shocked many pension holders who have experienced a vast improvement in the service they received from Aviva - well done chimps!!Although distracted by their strange desire to type out the entire portfolio of William Shakespeare on their portable typewriters - circus training coming good for the little rescals - the chimps are slowly grasping the technique of answering an incoming call. They do this by launching themselves head first onto their computer keyboard which is positioned in a car tyre hanging from a light fitting  thereby generating a response from the I.T system. This letter is then printed off and posted to the policy holder using the slowest method of delivery possible  wedged in the mouth of an elderly  limping  short-sighted tortoise that has no sense of direction.Although this response is utterly unhelpful and total nonsense for the customer  the chimps are exceeding all expectations  something that the previous incumbents never did because their response to incoming calls were always utterly unhelpful  total nonsense AND repetitive dumbness. The downside so far observed by using chimps  is that although they are highly skilled at holding cups of tea in a group  sitting around a table and gibbering away  they do have the tendency to roll their poo into small balls and flick them across the room. These balls of poop (not to be confused with the bull s**t thrown about by their zombie predecessors) does involve a great deal of expenditure on carpet and wall cleaner. In an attempt to improve their behaviour  various organ grinders have been contacted in order to try and reduce the airborne display of cr*p that is endemic within this pension claims team. It failed with the zombies and regretfully  it has failed with the chimps.However  with the Aviva brand so badly stained already - with black marks all round  with walls that look as though they have been pebbledashed by these poop balls - the management still remain positive that by dipping their recruitment toes into the animal gene pool  the battered reputation of Aviva pension claims will improve.End of &#39;Can this be true?&#39;Now a more direct rant.....&quot;Alpha&quot; = &#39;A&#39; list.....those chair warming zombies that the chimps replaced would not even make the &#39;Z&#39; list. In fact  there is not an alphabet yet devised on Earth or on any lifeless distant planet where they would be PROMOTED to be placed at the bottom of an alphabet. End of rant. Spleen vented - for now.
Adrian Boca,    18 August 2016,Phoned them  emailed  them regarding an upgrade for my insurance I did online   they seem to be to tyred to update my insurance online. They were OK last year but I think they are getting bankruptcy and don&#39;t care to much about customers.
Lynn owens,    10 August 2016,Lost a diamond from my ring and arranged a quote from a reputable jewellers. Aviva recommended their preferred jewellers which I agreed to. They have had my ring for over 2 months now and still no news when I can expect it back  apparently they are sourcing the diamond. Telephoned my rep at aviva who is looking into it and coming back to me within 48 hours  168 hours later and still waiting.
Sj Rogers,    09 August 2016,After my accident in May I immediately contacted Aviva and they arranged a courtesy car from Enterprise  for 14 day. This would have been fantastic but every single day I got a call from Enterprise saying Aviva had said to give the car back. I then had to phone Aviva up to would tell me they had said no such thing and they would contact Enterprise. By day 8 of this I was so fed up I just gave the car back and used a friend&#39;s. As my car was declared a write off  I then had the saga of agreeing a payout value. I had thought this was going to be simple as I had only bought the car back in January (£5000) and had all the invoices and receipts to prove it. Boy was I wrong  they first offered me a mere £3000! When I turned it down they then upped it to £4000. With this still being £1000 down on what I paid for the car I was still not happy. They asked me to provide other examples of replacements cars but due to the rarity of the vehicle I couldn&#39;t find a car of exactly the right mileage  age  colour  body style or spec that they would agree on. I then had a call from Aviva saying they would send me over an example they had found....5 hrs later and I receive an email saying they couldnt find one either so they most they would do is offer £4 500 and I could take up a complaint.I agreed to that for now and also agreed to by my car back for £990  which I was assured would be fine as they had put it on a safe guard scheme with CoPart Salvage. Fast forward 3 weeks and my car was delivered back with now with a damaged front bumper  smashed wing mirror  missing locking wheel nut key and worse of all  a completely different passenger alloy wheel with an incorrect sized  blown out tyre! I immediate spoke to Aviva and CoPart regarding this and of course CoPart denied all knowledge although when I asked for them to send pictures over  they must have ended up sending ones they didn&#39;t want me to see as in one picture is my car  completely intact &amp; with my alloy (minus original accident damage)  in another my car has a smashed wing mirror and my spare wheel on and then in another it looks like its been off-road rallying and has the blown out/damaged/misfitting alloy and tyre.Aviva paid me out an additional £500 as compensation as well as giving me back my £990. However  as the car I replaced mine with was of a lesser standard than the original due to the payout of only £4500  I had banked on using the bumper and alloys &amp; 4 brand new tyres off my old car on the new one and this now barely covers the tyres and alloys  let alone the bumper. Please avoid these 2 companies (especially CoPart!) if you have a desirable  hard to find car that you actually care about!
P Marsden,    07 August 2016,I could spend hours writing about how bad Aviva&#39;s repair network are ( Just Car Clinic).It took 5 months for them to complete a repair that was quoted as three days. One excuse after another. I wouldn&#39;t use them again if they provided insurance for free !!!!
Peppa,    06 August 2016,Aviva is like a Russian doll collecting other insurance companies - a bit like the old lady that swallowed the fly. One of its acquisitions is former door knockers (London&amp;Manchester) selling insurance from door to door to people on low incomes. L&amp;M went from there into the more lucrative endowment mortgage market  this time targeting mortgage regects through the tabloids. It was a scam  of course  that claimed many victims. CEO Mark Wilson has the dossier but keeping the lid on the L&amp;M scam - a bit like Mount Etna I suppose.
John Stephenson,    05 August 2016,I have been driving since 1982. I&#39;m 55 and own a 2002 Volvo. I have never claimed. In fact  I haven&#39;t been involved in an accident since a &quot;nudge&quot; in 83&#39;. I have 1 SP30 from 2013.Aviva want £1061. I haven&quot;t a clue why its so expensive. The car is garaged at night and in a works car park during the day.Thanks for the over 50&quot;s favour Aviva. It&#39;s about time companies like you were held to account. I&#39;m disgusted.Or am I being penalised like other honest folk who unfortunately live in a high uninsured drivers city? In fact  why even bother insuring my car? Oh yeh  cos&quot; I&quot;m honest!!!!!
Strapp Weeman,    04 August 2016,I got hit by an insured car which was not my fault . My car was insured for 11500 but they only payed out 8500 because my car was written off .when I tried to ring them to speak to them they just kept putting me on hold and no one would answer terrible company should not be operating at all crooks !!!!!!!!
Stephen Wagstaffe,    29 July 2016,Don&#39;t expect Aviva to pay out your private pension funds in any hurry. They make it as difficult as possible  probably to hang on to your money for as long as possible. My wife transferred her private pension  from another provider very easily within a few weeks  this into a drawdown and cash deposit. I dealt with the process for her. However with Aviva they made the whole process a nightmare. Now some three months later than required I finally obtained my money. As the money was required to be changed from sterling into euros it was important we did this prior to the Britexit vote and our move to Portugal. Failed miserably costing me not Aviva.I logged a complaint and now three weeks later I&#39;m still waiting for their complaint department to contact me. Aviva advised yesterday their sending letters to my old UK address though they are fully aware we moved to Portugal.
Rebecca,    29 July 2016,It&#39;s taken 3 months+ for Gillian Self of Aviva to reach 2 witness of mine (whom I regularly see at the business the accident occurred at) for statements. She&#39;s uncontactable via phone  and does not respond to emails unless the word &#39;complaint&#39; is brought up. She does not contact you  nor ask for any help with trouble contacting witness&#39;. Aviva wait call times are 20+ minutes every time. Never ever had an issue with Direct Line. Avoid at all costs! (My car was stationary and the drivers side door backed into.)
1.00E+14,    22 July 2016,Have a claim going though .it&#39;s now nearly 3 months since the Accident and they still haven&#39;t paid out .2 weeks over due from what they promised. Salvage company hassling me with calls and letters to take the car even though it&#39;s not been paid for !!Shocking service can&#39;t see how they can get away with it .Will have to seek legal advice now to recoupe where I&#39;m out of pocket
Sheila. McClean,    18 July 2016,Ten years ago we took out a mortgage with them  we asked their rep  could we pay it back   we were told after 10 years  we could   and a penilty if we payed befor then   we used are home  as collateral to buy a apartment in the sun   and sell after we were to old to travel   the 10 years are now up and the apartment is now up for sale .  Turkey is not the best place to sell at this moment in time   our statement as arrived stating that the debt is increasing by  £600 Per month and thay want £ 17 500 extra   this is pure GREED   their shares are sky high  there are other company s doing this  so shop carfully if you need this service   I have written to them stating we were never told about this £ 17 500   we have been told  they will look in to it   but they make it so hard to repay   we feel thay want our home .. Our home is now up for sale to make sure they don t get it
Sabah Khan,    16 July 2016,If I could give zero stars I would.  This company doesn&#39;t even deserve the time it&#39;s taken me to write this review. Thieves who steal my monthly premium and don&#39;t keep to their word.  Stay away!!! Unhappy customer (not for long).
Robert john,    14 July 2016,Car stolen in march this year reported stolen notified aviva they opened up a case.I rang them a few days later to ask if they had found my car because the police had found it burnt out they didn&#39;t no were my car was.So I Googled recovery companies and found the first one and rang them and they had my car.So I rang aviva saying I have found my car (a job they should of been doing) gave them the address of the pound they said they would collect it.2 weeks later my car was still in the pound so rang aviva to ask what was happening and was told the claims department are dealing with it.Than me and my wife were interviewed by the cotswold team after the interview the man that came out said he Would pass information on to aviva and access police report he said roughly it would take two weeks.Two weeks went by so I phoned and was told they are still awaiting the police report and that the police had given them a rough estimate of the 14th of June .So I rang 14th of June asked to speak with the man dealing with my case ALEX MCKENZIE was told he was busy and would pass on a message for him to ring me back guess what he didn&#39;t so I rang the next day 15th June and finally spoke to him he said still waiting for the police report.So I left it till July this year rang was on hold for an hour to be told the same.So I phoned the police asked about the police report gave them the crime reference number they found it and I received it today so did aviva so phoned aviva hoping for a good response to be told there reviewing the police report wich took me all of 5 minutes to read police had closed the case as there was no evidence they checked cctv and did house to house so they shut the case.Now I&#39;ve been told that they want to ask me a couple of questions tomorrow I pay almost  £300 a month to be treated like a criminal I would avoid this insurance company like the plague I&#39;ve had the phone put down on me Alex MCKENZIE was hardly ever available to speak and was left messages to ring me back wich he never did.And when I asked to speak to his up hand Jason gaulton was told hes on holiday or he wasn&#39;t in.I phoned customer service they found Jason gaulton and messaged him for me they were about to transfer me to Jason then all of a sudden ALEX MCKENZIE was available seems pretty dodgy to me as I was told by a member of ALEX MCKENZIE team that he wasn&#39;t available but the lady in customer service got hold of him straight away I would advise anyone  considering using this company do some research on them first once my matter is sorted I&#39;m going elsewhere for insurname it&#39;s taken nearly 5 months and basically nothing has been done I&#39;ve done most of the leg work eg finding my car getting the police reports so in other words doing there job for them and paying £300 a month to this idiot run company People avoid these fraudsters you&#39;ll end up being ripped off
Dr Erum A Khan,    13 July 2016,I had an accident on 16th June. That was the only time I could speak to Aviva after waiting for 40 minutes!I have tried to get in touch with them a few times after that as THERE HAS BEEN NO COMMUNICATION :written or via email. No luck!I have been waiting on phone for 40-45 minutes sometimes phone line goes dead other times I have hing up as have other things to do.Very horrible service. Will change my insurer. Don&#39;t think about going to them as your insurance company.
Louise Wilson,    12 July 2016,A have used Aviva for at least the last 3 years recommended by a friend for holiday insurance . My husband had a unfortunate accident while on holiday in Majorca and ended up in intensive care on the mend now may I add.From start to finish Aviva were excellent considering the horror stories I had heard from other holiday makers whose insurance company had not been in touch .My husband was hospitalised for 7 days. On being discharged we were not allowed to fly for a few days and we were put up in a Marriot hotel .Lovely had circumstances been different .Once my husband had fit to fly they got us flown home next day to airport neatest out home with transport waiting as my husband had cast and splint in both his hands .Other expenses I had to claim for when I got home was all simple done over the phone .And had there not been a computer glitch my money would have been paid in very quickly although have to say was paid in today only a week after returning from our holiday .Excellent service .
Nas,    11 July 2016,A customer of Aviva for over 3 years.When an uninsured driver hit our parked vehicle thats when the trouble sarted.It all unravelled very quickly.From the poor service we received to delayed days in getting the vehicle back all costing our company.You only truly know a company once you make a claim.To cut along story short they have been robbing customers for years and when they have to compensate they use every trick in the law book to get around it.What a bunch of  i will let who ever is reading this to finish of the sentence.Update 11/07/2016They have settled but only when i told them about TrustPilot  and about the review i have fired off.Gosh this site does make companies sit up and listen.The only problem is look how bad customer service has become in the uk.They eventually sorted problem out.From one star to three
George Bathgate,    07 July 2016,Just thought I would check aviva for the sake of it and seen loads of bad reviews  which I thought was strange but I do understand nothing is 100 percent and thought I am going to pass on my review here.1. I had heart surgery last year and had critical illness cover with Aviva. I found staff that dealt with me to be very effective.2. I have 2 cars currently insured with Aviva and have had no issues whatsoever. I was even informed that to buy separate breakdown cover might make my policy cheaper which is unusual for a company trying to decrease your payments.3. I have house insurance with Aviva and will continue to do so as the cover is more than adequate enough.4. This is the only &quot;negative&quot; thing I could comment on. I have just passed my motorcycle insurance and Aviva said they wouldn&#39;t insure me due to the bike I want to buy. The gentleman on the phone who was doing the quote checked two possibilities for me and said he would have to call me back which he did at the time given.I totally understand negative reviews here and have written a few myself but Aviva to me has been and still are a company that I will use.
Nippy,    06 July 2016,Forget using their motor claims handling number - you will wait between 35 minutes and 1 hour - And the accident was not even our fault ! It was one of their insured customers who admitted liability - When you finally get through you are treated rudely and abruptly - After this experience - I will never take insurance with Aviva and I am going to cancel all my life insurance policies - This organisation typifies all that is wrong with Corporate UK based companies - If Aviva care to look at this message - it is Claim Number is 16MMV065988 and the hopeless telephone number is 0345 0308860  &gt; Needless to say when I get through with this AVIVA are going to be billed for every phone call and every minute of my time -
tony whittaker,    23 June 2016,Why does Aviva quote it will take up to 32 days to allocate payments to my pension scheme   they always blame it on the it system !!!. What a load of bull-hit i say .WORST PENSION PROVIDER EVER .
Perth person,    20 June 2016,Only moved to Aviva 2 mths ago for x 2  car insurances. So far  have called x 5  and each time the ( nice ) person on the phone has failed to action what they said they would. Also forgot to add my no claims protected discount. Still awaiting that to be sorted out. I dont blame the helpline staff. Clearly this is a management / IT problem. Waited 11 mins one day /14 mins for telephone to be answered another. Unacceptable. I would NEVER use them again  no matter how cheap.
SunMoon,    20 June 2016,Its a challenge if you can get on their 0345 customer care numbers..I had to raise a claim and had to wait for &gt;30 mins and then I hung up. You need to understand these are premium numbers for which the mobile phone companies charges 45-55p per minute. There are no email notifications either if they try to send a notification to you  such notifications would just stay on their home and its very likely that no one would see these notifications as its not as interesting as fb or gmail to login everyday to check your car insurance.
Claire,    16 June 2016,This is the third insurance policy I&#39;ve taken out with Aviva and they&#39;ve been brilliant to deal with from start to finish  including when i had to make a claim. Quick  courteous and also the cheapest cover each time. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend them.
Richard,    16 June 2016,I&#39;ve been with Aviva for 20yrs+ I recently retired and my wife and I no longer require the life insurance policies we took out. In order to surrender these policies Aviva require both of us and the original two witnesses sign the paperwork which is fine then as requested I&#39;ve attached a cancelled cheque to the front of both sets of paperwork as as proof of the bank account to be used. the cheques are for the same account we&#39;ve used to pay Aviva monthly for 20+ years registered to exactly the same address. They also require proof of identity for myself  my wife and both witnesses ie passports and various bills. I think your probably getting the gist by now Aviva are happy to take your money but make it almost impossible to surrender policies and get a minute proportion of what you&#39;ve paid back.Update 7th August 2016I submitted surrender paperwork with the the required proof of identity documents and cancelled cheques for the account used to pay my premiums for 30yrs for my wife and I. I included a letter explaining that the original witnesses/trustees weren&#39;t prepared to to release personal documentation such as passport  driving licence  council tax bill  bank/building society statement etc  etc. to prove their identity. in my letter I requested Aviva invoke their contingency for situations where proof of identity for witnesses wasn&#39;t available explaining the documents I&#39;d supplied in the way of driving licences  council tax bill and blank cancelled cheques proved beyond doubt our identities  where we lived which was the same address when we took the policies out and the bank account was the same as used to pay Aviva for 30 years.Aviva responded by sending a letter with paperwork requesting we submit the personal documentation for the witnesses/trustees after I&#39;d gone to lengths explaining the people who originally signed the paperwork 30+ rears ago prefer not to release these documents. At the end of their letter they say &quot;under current UK Money Laundering legislation we must perform certain checks on the identity of our customers to help detect and prevent money laundering&quot; as required by the Financial Conduct Authority. I&#39;ve proved beyond doubt who my wife are  our address which remains the same as when we took the policies out and our bank account which is already on Aviva&#39;s records  under the circumstances I don&#39;t know what to do and Aviva have ignored my letter. In absolute disbelief I phoned Aviva to be told the appropriate person was busy and they world phone me any time up to 9th August at which point I was to phone them again if I hadn&#39;t received the promised call  so far nothing surprise  surprise  I CAN ONLY REITERATE WHAT I&#39;VE ALREADY SAID  AVIVA ARE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR MONEY BUT MAKE IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO SURRENDER LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES TO GET A MINUSCULE PROPORTION OF YOUR PAYMENTS BACK. I MAY HAVE TO SEEK GUIDANCE FROM A CONTACT I HAVE AT THE THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY. This is unbelievable...
Beachboyo,    14 June 2016,I had been with Aviva for my car insurance for many years. I couldn&#39;t believe that they asked me for an additional 80 pounds this year for precisely the same terms. I rang them to ask why the substantial rise  and they blamed insurance tax rises! I asked them to rethink and they said they couldn&#39;t. I went to LV to get a quote and they came in at 50% of Aviva&#39;s cost. Yes  half price! I can&#39;t believe that I stuck with Aviva so long. I should have left them ages ago. I will move all my other insurance away from them now on principle. Avoid them if you can: Aviva = big rip off!
Chris A,    09 June 2016,I didn&#39;t realise they were going to auto renew me in 3 weeks until I logged into my account online to get a car insurance quote  I hadn&#39;t received a letter or anything. Also  the renewal quote was higher than my previous quote despite me having made no claims.I wanted to cancel this auto renewal and found I couldn&#39;t do it online  neither with an automated method or with the online chat. I had to wait on the phone for over 30 minutes to speak to somebody and they also have the most irritating automated system for navigating the options. This alone means I will never consider using them for any product ever again.If you value your time  avoid Aviva.
stuart thomson,    04 June 2016,My son was involved in a clearly no fault accident (other driver in the wrong lane   failed to comply with lane marking) Has been passed from pillar to post.  2 claims staff agree he is not at fault the other 2 tried to convince him it was knock for knock . This happened 2 YEARS ago and my son has been unable to trade in or sell his car due to the damage. He has had to make temporary repairs to pass the MOT and has incurred increased. premiums twice as he has un unsettled claim.They are just not interested and we are now forced to seek legal advicein an attempt to resolve this farce. BE WARNED!!!!
Valentina,    31 May 2016,I asked for a quote last week and I got one  with no problems.This morning I called to buy the insurance based on their quote and they said that they can&#39;t give me the insurance anymore based on the risk assessment. No details changed from my side. They could not even explain why im no longer eligible. I&#39;m supposed to start driving tomorrow morning and now I have to look for another insurance in no time!
AJ,    17 May 2016,We have house and car insurance with them. The multi car policy is a great price. We have had a few issues with our house (plumbing and a breakin) and everytime I called they had people over to fix the issue and in the case of the breakin they actually paid out. You would not expect this of an insurance company - our previous ones were rubbish! Can&#39;t fault Aviva on anything and thanks for your help  especially on the burglary as that was very stressful.
Mr Griffiths,    09 May 2016,I reported a loss of a £4000 ring at 0930hours. By 1000hours I received an email confirming full amount minus £100 excess was to be paid to replace ring from store I purchased from.  I must say I insured it for right amount  kept all documentation and photographs  and didn&#39;t try to over claim or cut back on cover when I insured it. I do think sometimes people do this and still expect insurers to pay but why would they? Excellent Service
Paddy sy,    07 May 2016,Was a colleague selling their products in Barclay&#39;s...men the racism and bigotry is unreal speaking to them....also th claims process is such that you can&#39;t  claim anything...beware
Mrs Morrison,    23 April 2016,Purchased car insurance &amp; then number of cars in household changed -this involved an additional charge by AVIVA - despite fact other household cars not insured by them &amp; expected mileage for car which is is insured was correct. Circuitous argument about how they calculated car insurance ensued online with adviser providing inaccurate information about legal rights to cancel within 14 days &amp; incorrect advice to reduce number of cars to 1 despite household having more - involving additional payments to AVIVA. Won&#39;t use them again &amp; wont recommend to anyone!
Andrew,    15 April 2016,I&#39;ve had several negative experiences with Aviva in relation to their administration of my defined contribution pension scheme over the last 2-3 years but the latest one takes the biscuit. Yesterday they removed £38k from my pension and switched me into a fund I sold out of a month ago. They claimed the money was removed due to money laundering concerns which they subsequently realised had been triggered by human error on their side. In spite of them having all day to fix the problem  they managed to transfer back only £12k of the £38k they&#39;d removed so my pension is still £26k light. Incredibly  in spite of the unauthorised fund switch which was subsequently corrected  they then transferred my latest contribution into the wrong fund again. This was in spite of me filling in a form accompanying my contribution stating the fund that the contribution should go into.   Please do no make the mistake of trusting Aviva to manage your pension. You will sit in phone queues for 20-25 minutes  have to wait days or weeks for them to process contributions  transfers  and fund switches  they have a narrow choice of core funds  anything interesting has an annual management fee that will make your eyes water  their website seems to be permanently under development  with parts not working properly or throwing up random error messages.
H Sayeed,    14 April 2016,I recently had to deal with this company regarding a claim  as some client of this company happened to have an accident with my car. It look a bit long but at the end the claim was well sorted. I would say their customer service is good.
Matthew David Colebourne,    04 April 2016,My girlfriend suffered a broken knee whilst skiing.  Aviva could not have been more helpful or professional.  Their medical assistance company  CEGA Assistance  were fantastic; the hospital was contacted before we even arrived to confirm cover  they approved all the treatment promptly and then arranged travel back to the UK once she was released from hospital.  Made a stressful situation much easier.
Micheal,    31 March 2016,I have been with Aviva (used to be named Norwich Union) since 2004 ish and most time pay my yearly sum when I get the quote. The reason why I trust them so much was due to the fact they handled two accidents (none of our fault) very well for us. I have to thumb up for them about this  and their customer service are actually very ok. There wasn&#39;t much of an issue back in the days when we had only one CHEAP car. The premium stayed about the same year after year with small inflation linked increase  which I have no problem with. However when we moved few steps up with our cars  the yearly quote became issue. I know the more expensive the car is  the more premium of the insurance. I understand that. But why is big yearly increase?  In the last few years  the renewal quote from them are increased by 10%+ on yearly base with nothing has been changed from our side. There was one year the increase was about some 20% ish with the fact no changes&amp;claims had been made. I had to drop the courtesy car and reduce mileage to drive down the cost. This year I got a quote with 11% increase. So I decided enough is enough and got few other quotes from different company (6 in total). All of them are CHEAPER with the same conditions if not better. The other quotes after in range of 13% to 35% less than what I got from Aviva. This became interesting for a guy worked in the data industry and really make me think about the algorithm they use. If I may guess. What they are doing must be like this. 1. Does this guy has a expensive car? Yes? =&gt; deep pocket and cash cow2. Does this guy always stay with us? Yes? =&gt; lazy/busy cash cow3. Does this guy always pay auto renewal or call us back for discount? Yes? =&gt; cash cow caught and quote him 10% increase minimum. If he calls back  give him 3/4% discount.4. Did he pay? Yes =&gt; &quot;A Oui Voila&quot;. Now I know why they changed their name to Aviva.Well at the end I feel it&#39;s a bit unfair to complain without suggestion. In case Aviva is listening. If I was running an insurance company and want to keep loyal customer like myself  I will do the algorithm this way.1. Is this guy honest  loyal and trouble free? Yes? =&gt; good customer2. Can we keep the sum the same as last year? Yes? =&gt; Do it; No?=&gt;Do it with inflation only3. Did he pay? yes? =&gt; good let&#39;s keep him happy for another year.
tobyn skinner,    22 March 2016,They are a partner company of &#39;Only young drivers&#39; who harass  threaten you and scam. pass on your details to third party marketing companies and refuse to pay back money they owe. WOULD NOT TOUCH THEM WITH A BARGE POLE
Anton Kuchar,    05 February 2016,Having been with Aviva for many years  we have been thinking they provide 5 star insurance  but we couldn&#39;t beany more wrong.Our family has got everything insured through aviva:life insurance  building and contents multi car insurance etc.With 6 years no claims protected car insurance  policy on our 2 family cars we are spending a small fortune every year to keep our minds at peace knowing we should be getting excellent services in return if we need them.Unfortunately  Over 4 weeks ago my wife&#39;s car was vandalized  having windscreen and mirror damage which is a minor repair to deal with.I decided to call Aviva to sort it out  thinking it should take few days to have it sorted  but I was so wrong! Car was towed to BMW dealership where it was waiting to get authorization to be repaired. Engineer from aviva went to see it to assess the damage over 3 weeks ago and since then nothing has been happening. Thought Aviva was 5 star but it&#39;s far from it and we will be leaving them at the end of policy in August  because simple damage which would have been repaired very quickly elsewhere is taking forever to do?!I can&#39;t even bear to think that if someone died in our family and we had to make a claim through their life insurance.Things would probably not be as you would expect from 5 star company and we are very likely going to move all our policies somewhere else  because we are not getting value for our money at all!I would not recommend Aviva to anyone  because you are paying premium  but when you need to make a claim it can&#39;t get much more stressful than this and you are not getting services you pay for.Got ours car back today after nearly 5 weeks all repaired to high standard  just took way too long .
Susan Hedges,    04 February 2016,I had Aviva car insurance for years. A coach reversed into me and the driver lied about the situation. I was bullied to share responsibility which I refused since I had no intention of perjuring myself. Aviva passed the case onto two legal companies  The details of an independent witness I gave were not followed up  and the maps &amp; photos I sent which proved the other driver was a liar were ignored. This dragged on for a year.  I was summoned to court somewhere very inconvenient to me and a week before going to court I contacted the witness again [ fortunately on the same &#39;phone number and very nice] and legal team again and behold... the case was dropped. Did anything happen to the lying coach driver? No. A whole year of my time and effort plus worry which could have been sorted by Aviva&#39;s claims department  if they had done their job properly. Of course my insurance went up &#39;because I had made a claim&#39;. The following year it was doubled. I&#39;m with another company now.....
Neil,    21 January 2016,For the past 8 months they have been giving me the run-around after my RV was damaged after being sunk. The unit needed to be extricated using heavy equipment and ended up being twisted out of shape and cracked. The run-around started with Aviva Elete outsourcing the adjusters job to another company. That company in-turn outsourced it to another adjuster. I have had two major licenced shops check it over and they have deemed the unit beyond repair.I have sent all documentation and photos that their adjuster provided to the factory service center and they have quoted almost $180 000.00 to repair the unit. Their appraiser had me drive the damaged unit (which was barely derivable and unsafe) to an unlicensed shop for inspection. He then came out with a quote of $30 000.00 which they insist I take in a cash settlement and have the repairs done myself. After I complained about that they had a local shop weld together a tie rod end so that they could order me to drive it over 300 miles away to have the Aviva adjuster look at it. It was one of the most terrifying drives I have ever had to make and it took over 8 hours to complete. The adjust did not show up and I was forced to leave the unit there for him to look at and make my way back home. It has been down there for over 2 months now and there is no way I can drive it back without the front suspension and steering being properly repaired. There is no shop in the world that will even consider repairing the damages for the amount that they want me to settle for. I have 8 months of unanswered calls and emails from the worst customer service you have ever had to deal with and have been told that I will be losing my rights to this claim if I don&#39;t accept their offer within the next 4 months. After asking to speak to their ombudsman I was denied the right to even bring my case to him/her. I was told that I can &quot;hire my own appraiser&quot; and they might consider looking at their findings. Tell me  where do you find an appraiser that wants to go up against a company like Aviva? My next step is to contact the General Insurance Ombudsman and see if there is any help from that end. Beware  IMHO these people are as shady and heartless as it comes and you will regret the day that you ever signed up with them.I have now purchase aviva-insurance complaints.com and have set up a website where aviva customers can discuss their horrific treatment by this company and possible ways of dealing with them. Hopefully it will help at least a few customers that have been stonewalled as I have.
Jacky Ryan,    07 January 2016,I made a claim on line for a damaged Laptop  never heard a word  called customer services who said the department was closed but it was being dealt with  to this day I still have not heard a word. I will not renew because they obviously just want your money but do not want to handle you if you have an issue. I will no longer use them for any of my insurances  that includes car  buildings  contents and all the rest I had with them. Its ok being a good price but when we need you are USELESS. 3 months and still no CONTACT!
Saeed,    02 January 2016,Was received our multi car renewal quote which at first glance was twice what we paid last year although we did add a fourth car in September but was still way too much. As my children have their own cars I phoned them to remove the children from our cars to see if it was cheaper to insure my wife&#39;s and my car. It was! So I asked for these to be recorded and will let them know nearer to time of renewal. Called them today and strangely it went up by 10%. When inquired as to why this was the agent had no clues. When challenged them that the agent I spoke to a couple of weeks earlier had confirmed the price and recorded it  I was told that he only has what the screen has told them. I told the agent that Aviva is dishonest and as it is very close to my renewal date  they increased the premium. He replied that he doesn&#39;t think so. In that case I said that I would like a copy of the last recoding and that I will make this and the other recoding available to the Which? Magazine. He reluctantly agreed and said that it will take a few days and that someone will contact me in two days or so. My insurance is due for renewal in three days! When inquired about excess charges I was told that there is a voluntary excess but not compulsory one. When I checked the quote on line  there is clearly a compulsory charge of £250!They are clearly lying to their customers. I suggest to avoid them if you can.S.
Roger Hollingsworth,    31 December 2015,We had Aviva HSBC Travel insurance.  Our extended caravanning continental holiday was fully discussed with them before paying an additional premium for the holiday extension to our continently caravanning holiday.I have a pre-existing heart condition which had been fully accepted in writing by HSBC Aviva.On holiday I suffered a partially blocked heart artery and was rushed into a French cardiac unit for emergency treatment.  My wife immediately informed Aviva.After treatment the French cardiac unit would not permit me to drive and would only permit me to leave hospital after they had spoken to Aviva to confirm their willingness to fly me home.  I had to arrange for Aviva to contact the cardiac specialist.After leaving the cardiac unit  the only communication I had from Aviva was their refusal to accept medical insurance liability first demanding sight of the French cardiac units report  my full medical history from my GP back home and insisting on completion of a claim form.  It was only after I had made a formal complaint over the &#39;phone that their attitude softened but they still refused to confirm medical insurance cover.  It took 30 days for them to confirm medical cover.To come out of hospital and finding Aviva refusing to accept cover was extremely stressful especially as the caravan site was closing for the winter and we could not leave the caravan &amp; car with them.  I had to make my own arrangements through the Caravan Club motor insurance for them to fly a driver out to France to get me  my car and caravan back to the UK.Aviva subsequently claimed they had not acted because they knew of the Caravan Club help but I do not believe this because sometime later when I spoke to the Caravan Club  they had not heard from Aviva and said the rarely do in similar cases.Furthermore I find Aviva&#39;s policy misleading because the clause they use to demand a full medical history report before accepting liability is buried with in clause 15 of their policy.  It is easily missed when first reading the policy.  Personally  I find this clause and the way it is included in the policy and used  is an &quot;Unfair Condition of Contract&quot;.Furthermore  it is my personal opinion  I believe Aviva  failed in their &quot;Duty of Care&quot; towards me to ensure I got back home without undue stress which could have easily brought about a repeat heart attack.I shall never use Aviva again
E. Jones.,    29 December 2015,Almost three months ago  I requested paperwork and information as to how I can make a lump sum withdrawal from my pension plan policy. (Not an annuity). Despite several letters  email to CEO and a letter to the chief operations manager  I am still waiting.  On two occasions over the past year  they have failed to pay my monthly drawdowns.  Contempt toward their clients.
Charmain Leek,    29 December 2015,Ruined my family&#39;s life  I can no longer be confident I can financially and physically support my 2 daughter&#39;s  Aviva rejected my Critical Illness claim 9 years ago due to non disclosure for my illness MS  to which I honestly didn&#39;t know I was suffering from  I believed each GP&#39;s opinion as to why I was suffering numbness in my legs  I was told it as due to wearing high heels at a wedding and the fact I have Pev Cavos (high arches in my feet)  only when I sought private medical opinion was I diagnosed with MS  a locum wrote in my medical notes &quot;worried it may be MS&quot;&#39; that locum GP could not admit to their comments as it was so long ago.  Aviva now claim they honour most Critical Illness Claims  not comforting for the customers they have rejected in the past. Having had further relapses I now am eligible for the MS drug Tecfadira. I feel guilty as it costs the NHS a huge amount of money. 9 years on; I need to work ( I run my own business  so if I&#39;m ill I don&#39;t earn.  I am ashamed to mention my illness to my clients  if I admit to my disability  they may judge my care and support I offer to my clients as as Audiologist.) I am in my 5th week of MS med  Tecfidera  the symptoms are sporadic and I have had to cancel patient appointments due to the fact it has made me very ill. It&#39;s a rude awakening; what I am going to have to deal with from now on  heightened by the medication I am now on and holding on to the fact I can continue to work and provide for my daughters. I have almost had 9 years of upset (February for Aviva if they check their records) so the time has now come to make this case open to the UK public. Meanwhile I am doing my utmost to work  look after a family and a home  unfortunately it gets harder everyday. Thank you Aviva!
Trudi,    24 December 2015,Easily one of the worst experiences ever with a service provider.  I am going to do everything in my power to find a new insurance broker who does not deal with Aviva.  My no fault accident cost me a ton of time and money.  They were rude and unhelpful.
peter,    24 December 2015,As with many other similar large companies  in many sectors  they are ok until it goes wrong  then there customer services department is absolutely poor and of the lowest order.
helenjones,    17 December 2015,A friend has been seriously injured as a result of a companies negligenceThe company refused to provide their insurance details despite several requestsSo solicitors had to be involved the company even messed them around for weeksAviva is their insurer and after waiting requisite 3 months they changed assessor and wanted another 3months to decide on fault and still it goes onTheres not a single solitary thought for the innocent injured party and their wrecked lifeHow dare Aviva write articles claiming that &quot;claimants should deal with them direct &quot;&quot;That they dont like dealing with solicitors&quot;&quot;That the claims process is too long &quot;Its Aviva who need to get real and treat those injured by their clients with a great deal more respect plus the companies who cause accidents through negligence should be barred from ever getting insurance and be put out of business
Cladwell,    11 December 2015,I am not insured with Aviva but they owe me money following an accident where my daughter was the 3rd party.  They agree to the debt but simply don&#39;t pay and don&#39;t respond.They haven&#39;t paid up in over a year.  Their customer service people send lovely simpering emails and redirect me to Claims - who simply don&#39;t respond.A company which couldn&#39;t care less about anything or anyone but their money.Please - give them a wide berth.
Don Sade,    03 December 2015,Aviva is a really terrible company to insure with. My car insurance dropped by over 50% when I changed to NFU. Aviva rates are prohibitive and they offer no service benefit. There is no one person or local office to contact: every call to the call centre elicits a different operator who knows nothing about you or your policy and has to start from scratch. You wait ages in a queue when you call. Often the person you speak to hasn&#39;t a clue how to deal with your question. It is impersonal and inefficient. They do not even send out insurance documents but expect you to print your own off the site. Any change you make however small (like address) elicits further &#39;admin&#39; charges. They give nothing and charge the earth. The company appears to be nothing but a bloated PR exercise. Stay away!
Gem,    24 November 2015,Aviva sent me an email stating &#39;your car insurance is due for renewal  prices from just £187&#8207;&#39; I spent 10 minutes doing the quote and it&#39;s £401?? They had my full previous details from previous quote requests  therefore sending me that email is dishonest and misleading. I would love a response from them as to how they think the email you sent me is acceptable. It seems there is nowhere on their website to do this though  I wonder why! I&#39;ll stick with Compare the Market in future and never use them again for anything based on that.
SC,    19 November 2015,I am sure looking at other reviews  I do believe they are spurious at best. An Aviva client went through our fence   December 6th  2014 thankfully no one was outside at the time as they would have been seriously injured. We were asked to get two competitive quotes (fair enough!) we have been lied to (again today) with promised payment (work has been carried out which we have pud for ourselves). They wrote to us some weeks ago  after work which they had authorised to ask if we should share the cost. You can only imagine my response. They have today told me after telling me 2.5 weeks ago that a cheque is in the post that it could be authorised as they needed to get their customers admittance of guilt. Again fobbed off.If anyone tells me they are with this company in any kind of accident they will be seriously out of pocket and I will take them to the claims court. I will not deal with them again  ever.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
Andy S.,    14 November 2015,Moving from one car to another  I was a little nervous about getting the insurance all sorted out. The person I spoke to on the phone dealt with everything in a calm and efficient manner. Every time I have dealt with Aviva they have done everything that the policy says they should do with no issues.
Don Stenhouse,    13 November 2015,I have been dealing with the CEO office of Aviva they are a waste of time.The woman dealing with me trys to talk down to you These are people who haven&#39;t got a clue about building work and there telling me that the job their surveys are doing is correct.I have worked in construction for 25+ years and these numpties are telling me im wrong they are trying to force me to take a cash settlement for their incompetent contractors.I was dealing with a lady in Scotland first she was excellent.Then they moved my complaint down to Norwich really bad attitude. I have contacted the  ombudsman.  The only reason i give them 1 is because i had to.
Reaz,    12 November 2015,I unfortunately damaged my iPhone by getting in wet and the phone just suddenly went dead and didn&#39;t want to turn on. I had insurance cover with Avila though my Natwest bank account so gave them a call.They asked me a few questions about what happened and if I had any damage to any accessories too  which I did the case was also ruined.They accepted my claim within a few minutes and arranged for a £40 voucher to be available immediately at any Carphone warehouse for me to purchase a new case. The phone was delivered the very next day and was also the gold version I had originally.Absolutely fantastic service I couldn&#39;t fault.
Bansi Y,    11 November 2015,I am quite disgusted at how Aviva (Canada) is handling my claim. Despite providing all the required information  my claim is still &quot;without prejudice&quot;Darryl pushes us around. One month later  I am still making payments for this car and he still has my claim on &quot;without prejudice&quot;. Disgraceful.I will now go to social media with this case and move to the courts if necessary.Could you imagine if my house had burnt down ? I also have my home insurance with this terrible company.Stay away from this company. Be warned.
Brian Murphy,    06 November 2015,Get  a quotation at your peril.They take no notice of requests not to be contacted and invade you with both phone calls and emails-and they are not competitive.
A Jenkin,    04 November 2015,I am still waiting for liability to be established on a car insurance claim from 9 months ago.  Because of continued delays from Aviva  despite me contacting them  I involved the Financial Ombudsman.  Aviva assured them they would they keep me updated but I still heard nothing until today after following up with the Ombudsman.  I was informed by Aviva again today to just keep waiting.I rarely post reviews  but on this occasion would like to take the opportunity to raise awareness of the poor service from Aviva.
T Matthews,    28 October 2015,Very very good  I had an accident that was not my fault  they were very quick to get my car sorted.
fedup,    26 October 2015,I made the mistake of obtaining a quote for my car from Aviva.It was too expensive  so I didn&#39;t go ahead with it.That was 5 days ago  since then I have received 7  yes 7 ( SEVEN ) e-mails from them  which have also gone to my mobile ( 14 in total )saying &quot;We wanted to remind you that the motor insurance quote you requested from us is still valid. &quot;I telephoned their customer services after the first 6 e-mails to complain.Gentleman on the telephone said ...all sorted you will not receive any more &quot;.Famous last words...still they come.The most annoying thing about these e-mails...YOU CANNOT UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THEM &quot; there is no option available.I certainly would NEVER EVER get an online quote from AVIVA for anything again  this company will just NOT leave you alone. They must be totally desperate for the business if they have to harass potential customers  to this degree.Even after making a second phone call to them today to complain  the lady I spoke to said there was no guarantee she could stop these e-mails coming to me !!!!!DO NOT GET A QUOTE FROM AVIVA
Andy W,    23 October 2015,After an uneventful year of motoring and Aviva insurance  my renewal just came up. My premium was exactly the same as I had paid last year at £292.I noted that with the reminder through the post there was leaflet indicating £20 off my insurance for renewing on line.  So I went online through &#39;My Aviva&#39; and found my renewal premium was £301.89 which &#39;includes £20 discount for renewing online&#39;.  So I used the online Chat facility and quickly  learned that the UK government had increased insurance premium tax by 3.5% and my paper premium had been calculated 30 odd days ago.. Chat adviser said they would honour the paper premium.  I replied that sort of explains going from £292 to £302 but where was the £20 discount?  She replied she would honor that but she&#39;d have to take the payment manually.  We did this  but although I quickly received email confirmation of renewal  I was a little concerned there was no record of me having paid £272 through the secure server.  She said she&#39;d email me a receipt  and she did!  Faultless service!!  Maybe its more common that those users with a complaint use Trustpilot?
Ross O Donnell,    21 October 2015,I moved to Aviva last year after AXA (another shower of pigs) raised my premium by &#8364;300. I&#39;m 37 with 20 years claim free  penalty point free driving. I think I&#39;ve only ever claimed a couple of windscreens. Last year Aviva quoted me &#8364;325 full comp with all the bells and whistles. It was an exceptional price  a full &#8364;300 cheaper than AXA. I jumped at it and haven&#39;t had any need to contact Aviva since. No claims  points  accidents  windscreens etc all year long. My renewal arrived this morning. &#8364;547.18. That&#39;s as near as makes little difference a 65% increase. Figuring it was wrong or whatever I rang and got a lovely Pakistani / Indian man on the phone who I found very difficult to understand. I was polite but I made my points and kept my cool. After putting me on hold for a few minutes while he &quot;checked&quot; the system I was told that despite  all of his efforts there was nothing he could do blah blah blah. In a nutshell Aviva will suck you in with a great introductory offer and that&#39;s where it ends. They couldn&#39;t even justify the increase  all I got was &quot;it&#39;s an industry wide increase&quot;. A 65% increase on my premium for being a model customer. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!
Garry Teece,    13 October 2015,17 years driving in the Middle East (10 years in Oman and 7 years in Dubai) insured via AXA Gulf and they wouldn&#39;t consider insuring my vehicle when I came back to the UK. Even with evidence of 5 years + no claims discount their policy does not include these territories  yet they will insure you from the USA  Australia etc.  even if you have been insured through Joe Bloggs backstreet insurers.So they won&#39;t get to insure the rest of my requirements in that case  3 bikes and the house contents will go elsewhere but Aviva
Andrew Silk,    13 October 2015,I am a customer of Aviva - I went onto my online documents to try and change my address.I couldn&#39;t do this online and so had to use their online chat facility to do this.I was quoted an additional premium of £40 a month which I thought was extremely steep. Having searched for my own NEW policy online before I spoke to the online chat robot  I found a policy that matched my existing policy EXACTLY and Aviva were quoting £95.00 per month.When I challenged the robot  I was told that they were unable to do anything. I told them I didn&#39;t want any changes to be made to my policy as I would phone up as was not satisfied. I was then warned that my insurance policy would be invalid if I did not agree to the changes. So  having had my hands tied by one of their advisors  I agreed o the changes being made and I got straight onto the phone.I spoke to an advisor who said &#39;The price is the price&#39;  which I find not only rude but incredibly discriminatory that they can offer a lower price to a new customer. Furthermore  having demanded to speak to a Team Manager  he repeated the same things. He told me that the new policy quote was actually only a £30 difference for the total amount payable for the year and proceeded to tell me that he couldn&#39;t change anything. Again  I challenged him about why the diference in monthly premium was over £40 if the yearly amount payable is only £30 difference? No answer.He told me that I would have admin charges. Aviva advertise that if you make changes online  you will not be charged any admin charges....He went away and had a look and confirmed that I had changed my address online and so the admin charges would not be applied. As I challenged him more into why the price difference was only £30 per year but translated into an unproportional £40 per MONTH  he put me on hold and then came back 10 minutes later and said that I did indeed have the admin charges applied to my account and he would get these removed. After a further 10 minutes  he comes back with a price that honours the premium for the new customer quote I had done online.Disgusting. Why can&#39;t Aviva just do what they can for their customers instead of lying to us about not being able to change the prices and adjusting an ignorant attitude.So after what felt like a lifetime&#39;s phone call  I got the price reduced vs. what was quoted as a change on my policy and yet I am stillleft feeling frustrated by the lack of customerservice and the fact I had to spend over an hour of my time arguing with them  listening to them telling me they can&#39;t change anything to end up getting what I wanted anyway...Absolutely disgusting.Had I not challenged  I would have been charged the admin charges  despite Aviva&#39;s advertisement that online changes are free!!I now wonder if he lied about there being admin charges on my account in the first place or whether he was finding a reason to be able to change the prices without making it abundantly obviously that he lied to me about not being able to change anything..Either way  it is clear to me that Aviva clearly train their team members to lie to their customer and try to find ways and reasons to avoid doing the best for their existing customer base...Good job Aviva - way to gain customer loyalty!
JAMES,    01 September 2015,Over 8 weeks ago I was hit by an aviva insured driver. 8 weeks later I still haven&#39;t received my payout so I can go and buy my Cat C car back from the accident claims company I&#39;m with. Your driver admitted fault and yet I&#39;m still waiting to receive my payout.8 weeks with a courtesy car &amp; 8 weeks of compound fees being charged to you and unfortunately its your customers that will suffer.Avoid this company
Adam Smith,    04 August 2015,Knowledge of some customer service advisors appears to be low resulting in a lot of wasted time and effort regarding a small claim for a mobile phone. Premium also went up extortionately after claim.
mrfedup,    30 July 2015,absolute disgrace from irwin to their claims who allegedly are in collusion to balance books.  Customer services admitted that as other driver also with aviva the claim will take longer! Refusal to reply to complaints  pass the buck  irwin closing down case without consultation and a renewal quote so expensive plus lost excess for an accident not my fault. Avoid at all costs i mean fancy quoting 1300 pounds for a cat d car worth 200! if you have an accident you do not want to be with irwin or deal with incompetent claims department! avoid avoid avoid
Barrie,    23 July 2015,At work we have a Health policy with Aviva. I recently had to make a claim on it. Once the paperwork was across to them a customer representative called me to confirm my details and go through my claim.Once this was done I had a further call back in the afternoon saying that they need my notes to process the claim.This was done within 2 days  the next day they called to say that everything had gone through and that I could go ahead.They provided an excellent service within their Health Insurance department.
robert beevers,    07 July 2015,aviva paid out a false claim   when somebody claimed that my sons motorbike had fallen onto a scooter whilst parked in the bike shed in a private carpark outside college . this would be very unlikely as when the bike is parked there it is chained up to his friends bike   also my son is only part time at college and the &quot;incedent&quot; supposedly took place on a day that my son dose not attend   I sent proof to aviva that my son was not even there at the time and photos that my sons bike has no damage but they have lost this     they paid the scooter owner £800 within 3 weeks but did not notify me until over six months after ???  ( since then I have found out that the scooter owner is also insured with aviva ) the plot thickens lol   the scooter owner also should not even be insured as the engine fitted is 70cc  not the legal 49cc it should be . now my son has a car and his new insurance company is tryingto double his premiums because of this   aviva think Im letting this go but I will win in the end . INSURE WITH AVIVA AT YOUR OWN PERIL  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
RK,    29 June 2015,I spent my time typing in all the details and then at the end got this: An error has occurred! Sorry  we are having technical problems with our website and cannot provide a quote at the moment.We apologise for the poor service. Please try us again later or use the &#8220;Back&#8221; button to return to your details and try again Alternatively please call us on the number shown on the right (calls may be recorded and/or monitored)Their online advisor named &quot;Michael&quot; had a cheek to say &quot;Have you tried doing the quote again to see if it was just a one time error you might of experienced?&quot; So they want me to retype all the details just to see if it was one time or not where as the site clearly states &quot;Sorry  we are having technical problems with our website and cannot provide a quote at the moment.&quot;
frank,    14 June 2015,I was involved in 2 accidents. Met police investigation said non fault  Aviva behind my back paid another party  never questioned me. Another one just seemed as total scam  where apparently I had an accident and I didn&#39;t stop. No CCTV  not a single scratch  no nothing  Aviva investigator decided to other partys compensation. You have been warned.
not a happy aviva customer,    04 June 2015,I&#39;ve been a happy aviva content insurance customer until a few days ago when I actually had to speak to them.My policy was cancelled after I&#39;ve called to change my address.The reason - I live (and have previously lived) in a shared accommodation! The question weather I live in a shared accommodation was mysteriously absent from the on-line form when I signed up.They acknowledged this over the phone and liability was passed on to poor web developers.In summary:Over the last six months I&#39;ve (over)paid more than £100 for aviva home content insurance and all I got from them is a poorly written letter saying that my policy will be cancelled in two weeks.Also  no refund.I&#39;m writing this review on 04.06.2015 in case anyone wants to refer to it in the future.
Richard,    27 May 2015,Really expensive nearly 2000 pound for two cars with 10 years NO claims and 1 year No claims twice as much as admiral totally unrealistic.
Edward,    10 May 2015,i was involved in an accident which was my fault  however for two years i was hounded by the other drivers insurance company and ended up being taken to court  the reason was that aviva had told them i was not insured with them because they had LOST MY FILE!! to make matters worse they had paid out 12 false claims in my wifes name but not my legitamate one. when we complained as we had lost our car  earnings ect they refused to answer our compaints they have to date refused to answer why they have not paid what they owe us  the stress of it all caused my wife to have a breakdown and was put on medication for over 4 years and she lost over a year of work with stress/ depression and anxiety. AVIVA CAR INSURANCE are scum  lying scum. i have sent a full story to several newspapers and despite talking to the sun newspaper my story has yet to be printed but i will continue to fight this and get some justice.
Des Wilkinson,    07 May 2015,When  I was in hospital after an accident -they recovered my vehicleto Copart 45 miles away - as it was a write off ...they sold my car &amp; did NOT permit me ample time to be able to recover my personal belongings ...about £1000 in value---gave me a derisory £150.00 compensation -Disgusting !Their claims team are obnoxious &amp; very impudent ..I was a loyal customer NOT anymore - !!!!..
Chloe B,    03 April 2015,Numerous problems  first year of policy was competitive rate &amp; no problems. Came to renewal  promised £20 discount if I did it online (my aviva). This would not work so called Aviva. The representative talked me through it  still wouldn&#39;t work  he tried it remotely  still wouldn&#39;t work. So he had to go through the accounts dept to honour the £20discount (took 2 days). Then later in the policy  came to change my car -like for like model. After renewal problems I phoned. Gave my details  paid the slight increase in premium &amp; was then told at the END of the call I could have saved the £20 admin fee by going online. I commented that courtesy would have been for this to be suggested at start of the call so could I have a refund and then I would go online and do it. Was told that I could have the refund  he would call me back the following day. No call. I called back 2 days later and spoke to a very  rude representative who told me I was not entitled to a refund and that there were hundreds of operatives with the same name as the one I spoke to (even though the calls were logged) he also said that they don&#39;t tell customers about going online and not being charged  as they don&#39;t want customers to feel like they&#39;re being made to do so. He said he would email who I had previously spoken to to call me back (funny how he now knew which of the many names to find now) the return call would be within 48hrs- I&#39;m still waiting 6 days later. Shall be phoning back &amp; not renewing my policy. Simple small things which Aviva could have got right. Customers want good service and to be aware of the options (at the beginning of the calls).
Georgie Fromson,    02 April 2015,When I first took out my policy they had my car details wrong and when I told them to change them they decided to charge me an extra £500 which was outrageous.  Then this year I was over-charged £1700 on the renewel of my car insurance.  They steal your money without getting permission from you to re-new your car insurance.  Then to top it all out of the £2600 they took out of my account they only re-imbursed me £2200 of it because I hadn&#39;t informed them to not re-new my policy.  I had a massive argument with them over the phone saying they took my money without informing me first.  When I asked to see the &quot;email&quot; they sent me the month previously they failed to produce it - I had no record of it in my email account so they were lying to me.  In conclusion  they made it very difficult for me to cancel my car insurance despite them charging me so much money and then they stole £400 from me when I asked for a cancellation. A big massive CON company.  I have now had a car insurance quote for £1000 which is £1600 less that what they had charged me.  Aviva then told me to go into my account online to access the email and get a letter stating my no claims bonus but I cannot log in to my account since cancelling the policy.  I rang up for the 4th time and the person I spoke to said they would email me about getting this letter and I have had NO email since speaking with them despite confirming my email address.  Everytime I ring them up they seem to lie to you about everything.  It is the worst customer service from a car insurance company I have ever experienced.  I WARN YOU - DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY.  The very fact that they are not on the compare websites says something about them and they steal your money.I don&#39;t usually post bad reviews but I had to do for Aviva!
Frank J Ivins,    30 March 2015,Just a lot red tape.  They make it very easy to take your money but very difficult to cancel a policy.
Megan Darby,    26 March 2015,I advise everyone to stay away from this company.I chased AVIVA 5 times in two weeks prior to my car going in for repairs so I could be reassured I would get my £650 excess back!! Being reassured on numerous occations I went ahead with the repair!!The day after the repair I phoned AVIVA for my next steps in claiming my excess to be told the Taxi Driver that hit me was uninsured.Why did it take Aviva 3MONTHS to tell me this. I had cheaper quotes for my repair but they insisted I was to go with the company they recommend. They have taken my 2 years no claims to 0. I started driving 2 years ago and for something that isn&#39;t my fault they have done nothing to help.They have now left me with the bill and have said and I quote &#39;if you want your excess back you need to get in touch with the third party yourself to claim that money back&#39;I now ask  &#39;Whats the reason for paying AVIVA £1500 a year  when they have done nothing to help&#39;
John,    26 March 2015,Avoid at all costs. Had a Whole Life assurance with them in excess of twenty years. That was my biggest mistake  I should have canceled when they took over Norwich Union.
Peter,    15 March 2015,Dose  n t  look good at the moment read reviews of past recent payouts of endowment and insurance policies
Eddie,    06 February 2015,Insured home with Aviva for 10 plus years never made a claim then had to for a plumbing emergency and they were horrendous  they really did make a bad situation worse and I vowed I would never insure anything with them again. Forgot the drama after a few years and insured my car with them  many years of no claims then had to make a claim and guess what? they have wriggled out of paying anything. Be warned!! don&#39;t go there.
Tracy Coulthard,    02 February 2015,I had an accident in Febuary last year and reported it straight away to Aviva. They fixed my car and I was told to pay the excess to the garage while they sorted the claim.  My car had to go back to the garage three times where they hadn&#39;t repaired it properly the first two times but then I thought everything would go fine as it was to do with the garage and not Aviva. Wrong!! 3 months later I recieved a letter from Aviva saying I hadn&#39;t reported the accident and I would be liable for the costs of the 3rd party if I didn&#39;t comply! They even had the events of the accident all wrong as they had evidently lost my statements about the accident and seemed to be just picking random events. Nearly a year later after the accident I am still in contention with Aviva and their complaints procedure. If you want an insurance company that has no empathy and a years worth of hassle if you have an accident then choose Aviva. If not then Avoid  Avoid Avoid and choose a decent one.
Ian,    01 January 2015,Of all the companies I have ever personally dealt with  Aviva (ex-Norwich Union) is the worst. From my personal experience unlike other home insurance companies  who when you have a legimate claim for home damage send an insurance advisor to help you understand your legal right to claim. Aviva seem to send insurance advisors  who&#39;s basic premise is to stop the claim or provide excuses of why it is the home owners fault and why the insurance claim cannot be settled.In any exchange of services  where a transaction between a purchaser (the home owner) and the home insurer there is an exchange of monies (from the home owner) to the insurer to protect your property and belonging. Aviva seem to have forgotten the basis of this &quot;exchange of transactions&quot;. Because of the experiences I have had with Aviva (after taking them to the Financial Ombudsman and County Court)  I will never again insure my house  car or any personal belonging or capital with this company and advise anyone to do the same.
Sarah Smith,    19 December 2014,My car was involved in an accident when driven by my mechanic. I don&#39;t use Aviva insurance as heard too many horror stories but guess who my mechanic uses!!!  Kindertons/via AVIVA! Great!  I&#39;m the innocent party as I wasn&#39;t even IN the car when it happened but guess who has spent the last 3 weeks getting shafted and it isn&#39;t over yet!  Yes 3 weeks  despite the police being at the scene and the driver admitting liability at the scene  signing statements and being prosecuted by the police but Aviva didn&#39;t know anything about this..........so they claim!  Its taken 3 weeks to decide if they will be bothered to repair and they had the audicity to tell me that (having only just bought and paid for the car) they would only pay what THEIR mechanic said it was worth regardless and this was by a manager once I had started an official complaint.  I can&#39;t see my car/the damage or even choose where my car gets repaired. I&#39;m in Surrey and my car is in Southall somewhere and has been for 3 weeks!  My mechanic viewed the car and advised the company he had a body shop already to repair and get the car back to me within the first week............they refused.  So now Xmas is approaching  I&#39;ve been given a gas guzzling loaner that is taking twice the amount of disel than mine does. I&#39;ve spent endless hours on phonecalls telling these idiots its NOT my policy but my mechanics and listening to them blame all and sundry except themselves for the delays and sheer incompetence thus far.  I still have no car and still have no idea when it will be returned..............................I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back with more to the story  its likely to end as smoothly as it started..........  PLEASE PEOPLE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Martin,    18 November 2014,Aviva driver hit me in Jan 2014 it&#39;s now Nov 2014 and Aviva are still refusing to pay me any loss of earnings because I put a whiplash claim in. I am self employed and aviva is refusing to pay 4 days loss of earnings. My old insurance (Privilege) owes me 11 days but refuses to pay me till Aviva pay. Outstanding is over £1000 in total by both insurers and I am trying to get by all year £1000 out of pocket. Why would I have to wait until they pay out on the personal injury claim?
Jayne,    06 November 2014,Had a accident on the 1-10-2014 straight away had a text telling me I&#39;ve gat a personal adviser named Matt  never spoken to him and he&#39;s never called lol   told car was a wright off third part to pay accepted offer and told the cheque was in post 4weeks later got it paid it in bank on 03-11-2014 put deposit on new car ready to collect on Friday 07-11-2014 fantastic cannot wait   only to find out Thursday night 06-11-2014 from my bank that the cheque as bounced WHAT .so no car to collect and no car to get around because the hire car has gone back will be phoning first thing and phoning the insurance ombudsman. what a joke thanks a lot aviva hope many people will read my story and decide to insure with somebody else like I will myself next year.....
Monica,    02 November 2014,Hello This is very disappointed to see that you pay for an insurance that not even reply back to your emails.I just need a simple proof of purchase from Aviva and this is one week since I sent out an email and no one has replied back yet.Ref KMM410041V23740L0KMI will contact my bank and will ask for the process to send a formal complaint.Monica
Hetty King,    10 October 2014,I already pay £1 200 a year to insure my truck (classed as a commercial vehicle) and I wanted to add my new Mercedes to the policy but they wouldn&#39;t give me a multi-car discount so have gone elsewhere and shall be renewing elsewhere in June also.
Jamie Taylor,    17 September 2014,I had an accident in April  of which it was decided that I lost the case  Aviva never kept me up to date with what was happening  I had to chase them through every step of the way  and I never knew where I stood with the claim. I never felt like they were on my side throughout all of it  I feel if they were actually doing there job properly I may of won the case. I&#39;ve never experienced such bad customer service  I&#39;m very disappointed and will most defiantly never go with Aviva ever again and neither will my family.
Wendy Wakeham,    11 September 2014,Over 2 years ago we had a car accident  Aviva farmed out the claim  I have had a serious back injury  with NHS scan which I arranged myself to prove I have prolapsed disc. The other side has admitted liability and yet were still going through 3rd party medicals  I am in serious pain every day  no chance of ever working  we complained to Aviva but keep getting the same useless company dealing with it who are dragging there feet.The Tv adverts say they welcome customers reviews but will not let us on. Seriously fed up with Aviva.....please do not trust there adverts customer service are useless.......
Douglas,    05 September 2014,I am a repeat customer with aviva with multiple policies across car  house and life.My last multi-car policy renewal premium was over the odds but not by enough to drive me away however this time the premium is outrageous.I strongly urge anyone to avoid these con artists.
J Roder,    20 August 2014,Had direct line car insurance  after they offered me a renewal at 1500£... 40% higher than previoius year despite i had no claim and when asking them  feed back: prices/costs gone up   i shopped around and found Aviva  my renewal was 50% of the Directline price. Even the following year my renewal was nearly flat vs previous year. Had expected they just wanted to lure me in and next year big increase. But no all fine sofar.
Mr Tsang,    21 July 2014,My insurance is with Tesco Car Insurance but underwritten by Aviva! I had a car accident about two months ago which was the 3rd party fault. Although she didn&#39;t admit it strict away but my Ipad&#39;s photos and brief accident descriptions were proving me right otherwise. What I needed to do was just to phone up Tesco Car Insurance who arranged Aviva&#39;s Car Accident Claim Mangement to call me to practically arrange EVERTHING for me. This included collecting my car and dropped off a courtsy car on the SAME day when I had that accident. Further more  Tesco Car Ins/Aviva Legal Team had rang me the next day to suggest that I could have my insurance EXCESS being claimed back from the 3rd party as well. Aviva&#39;s appointed Car Accident Repair Centre had repaired by car well in about 1.5 week and even gave my car a &quot;complete&quot; clean-up from outside to inside before its delivery back to my home address  which were quite impressive. Above all I received a letter from Aviva saying that my car insurance claim had been fully settled without incurring at cost of myself and my no-claim discount is still protected!!So the overall experience with Tesco Car Insurance &amp; Aviva Car Insurance has been a good experience without me worrying about it throughout! My only &quot;slight&quot; complaint  which I expressed to the Claim Management at that time  was the courtsy car I had was a bit OLD  i.e. 2006 model and a bit noisy too!!!However I would happy to deal with Aviva either via your Car Insurance Company as &quot;under-writter&quot; or directly with them.
Garry Daniels,    10 July 2014,Vandalism claim  written off and cheque received in 4 days. Excellent contact and UK call centres!
Summer Jamisen,    04 July 2014,I had home insurance with aviva  I had a house fire and lost everything. Trying to get through to aviva was a nightmare they were incompetent and hung up on me several times. They left me for 3 weeks with nothing then thought a starting payment of £300 was exceptable. Me and my son had no clothes or anywhere to stay and I had to take out a loan to cover hotel costs as they would only refund me the cost once an invoice had been received and these went into a month long backlog! The whole experience was awful I would never insure with them again. Recently I had a car accident and the person that hit me was insured with aviva  my insurance company is now taking this company to court as the accident was 7 months ago and aviva have ignored all correspondence from them. Apparently this is normal with aviva and other companies dread dealing with them. I wouldn&#39;t insure with then if it was free they should be struck off.
Sidney Carne,    18 June 2014,Been fighting for justice for over 20 months with Aviva  I would not use them ever again  they are only interested in taking your money &amp; doing nothing for it.This is there car insurance  my neighbour reversed into my car when I was reversing into my driveway  he made a hole in the front bumper on the passenger side  my neighbour was very apologetic  said he could not afford a new bumper &amp; would have to go though his insurance.I sent details and a photo of both cars to Aviva  it was clear to see  but I got a letter from them that the other company said it was 50/50  how I could be 50% to blame when even my neighbour said I was revering away from him!I refused to except this  this went on with Aviva for 6 months  I had the hole patched up in the mean time  because I wanted them to pay for it  but they said they could not take it any further until the job was done so they could have the full price of what to claim for.This I got done at a garage of there choosing  it came to £419  I had to pay the first excess of £350  I am sure they hoped I would forget about it.I had to keep on at the phone to them  never got a reply from Aviva  even though they have my phone number  postal address &amp; e.mail.After a year they said they have put it into the hands of there Solicitors  Proddow McKay  so for the last 8 months I have been phoning them  they said they had sent a letter to the other Insurance Company threatening them with Court action  it seems they must know Aviva very well  because they haven&#39;t bothered to send them a reply.Aviva Solicitors have told me that Aviva are not taking it any further  because there is only £69 in it for them  what about the hundreds I paid for my insurance  the £350 that I should have back  and also now £110 that I had to pay extra to another insurance company  who said I would get it back if I win the case!It would have been cheaper if I said to my neighbour  forget about it  I will just go and bye myself a new bumper.So avoid Aviva like the plague  they are only interested in your money  not working for it.
FelicitySnowden,    11 June 2014,we had a major house fire in 2010 and I sure can talk from experience. Aviva who we have been insured with for many years to cover both contents and buildings have been as awkward as could be. For 7 months they had us move from place to place 9 times. 4 years on their builders who they chose has left the place in a state with tiles falling off the roof as they reused the same old fire damaged tiles  great big holes in the walls left by the builders  leaking pipes and leaking toilet  substandard floor boards laid  bits of the shrinking ceiling boards falling down as the untreated knots shrink and the boards are twisting. etc etc- Aviva denied any responsibility except where i have paid huge sums for experts to come and assess and find that the loo was not even put in correctly and they used wrong connectors. Aviva did not want to include the curtain poles etc in the building insurance element           they have tried every imaginable cop out. They might seem cheap when you are paying the premium but if they refuse to pay up and act in such a fashion that causes massive trauma to the insured people then its best to go for a better quality insurer. Avoid them like the plague is my advice. they ripped out all of the wiring and then announced that the rewiring was not covered despite it being clearly in the insurance buildings policy wording.  They rewired the house but then want me to pay for it. The builders told me that the rewiring is automatically redone after a fire due to water damage - but Aviva want me to pay them for it. Also they ripped out the built in wardrobes but have not replaced them etc  Four years on and its been hassle and awkwardness from them all the way.  And as they have not settled the claim I have been told I cannot get insurance elsewhere as the claim is formally open still.  Is that entrapment or what?   A total screw up you could say. Does anybody know if there is any way of checking what proportions of cases re aviva that go to the ombudsman are upheld  Perhaps its time the CEO woke up and had a strong coffee and resolves the lousy service being given out by his company.  His email address is   officeofceo@aviva.com  and his telephone no is 02072832000  According to Google the CEO is David Barral but it also names Mr Mark Wilson - perhaps one fled the mess?  Lets hope the new CEO is a real man and will deal with the clients fairly.
John Messias,    21 May 2014,Will never recommend nor renew with these guys every time we call them we are placed on hold for long periods and given conflicting information. Seems to me that they try everything not to settle your claim or to reduce the amount they pay out. We were with Axa PPP for  15yrs before aviva and never had the problems in that period that we&#39;ve had with aviva in less than a year!
Tom Coulson,    10 May 2014,Really helpful staff  quick to respond and sorted out the issue with my policy document immediately. Highly recommended.
K Paterson,    26 April 2014,I&#39;m currently going through Aviva for health insurance for my wife&#39;s cancer treatment. They&#39;ve been excellent. I can always speak to someone very quickly and they&#39;ve had no quibbles about cover. I hadn&#39;t realised how many operations  specialists and drugs were needed. They&#39;ve clearly outlined ongoing cover for the subsequent years too. Can&#39;t complain  it&#39;s been one less thing to worry about. They even covered psychotherapy treatment for my wife&#39;s &#39;pass out&#39; needle phobia  which has greatly helped her face the ordeal of surgical  chemo ordeals.
Kaiser Soseh,    22 April 2014,Norwich Union used to be so good  but now as Aviva they never answer the phone when you need them  (on hold for 10 minutes)  they don&#39;t pay on time and they never call you when you e-mail them. I am taking all my business (commercial and personal) from them because they are just too much trouble to work with.
Ferdi Hernandez,    16 April 2014,I&#39;ve had contents insurance with them for over 2 years  never had any issues even when we had to change address and items had to be moved in. Easy to contact and quick to respond
Giles Back,    03 April 2014,After having an at fault accident last year I was really pleased with how quickly and efficiently Aviva dealt with my claim  arranging for the repair of my car in no time at all.  I was concerned that come renewal time my premium would go through the roof but was pleasantly surprised that it did not change that much despite making a claim on my policy.  Even after shopping around as I do every year I was not able to better it so have stuck with them again this year.
Rachel Morley,    01 April 2014,Aviva offered me the best price when I came to buy (and I&#39;m confident about the cover I&#39;m getting).  It was also really easy to buy online  I got a quote really quickly and bought my policy easily - great.  I even added my bf to my policy (multicar) and got a fantactic price to cover both.But the bit I&#39;m really please with was that when my bf changed his car  I logged on to my policy and amended online.  There was no extra cost and I did it in less than 5 minutes  it was really easy which is so refreshing!  I&#39;d definitely recommend them.
Chris Lake,    31 March 2014,Just had a letter to tell me that despite updating my bank details with them  they tried to use a non existent account couldn&#39;t get the cash so cancelled my policy. This wouldn&#39;t be so bad except the letter to tell me is dated a month after they have decided to do this  so that&#39;s helpful. If you look on-line I am far from the only person to have my insurance cancelled without notification so be very wary using them! Just glad I found out before anything happened but some have not been so lucky! Be wary of the website too my negative review wasn&#39;t  so what&#39;s on there is biased crap! Avoid like the plague!!!
Michael Brenda Mole,    22 March 2014,Have bought 4 pensions over the years  unfortunately 3 of them have been taken over by  Aviva  and have suffered bad management  neglect  mistakes Aviva say oops and we have been paying compensation for 7 years.have yet to come across any one who has been compensated.can not get any info from Aviva get stopped by the Indian call centre your savings pensions are not safe with Aviva why have Aviva put over £ 230 million to one side as promise to pay disaffected costumers to top it all the FSA is allowing Aviva  to settle when and if they want to taking as long as thy want to Aviva will not release  any information on how many people affected and by how much and the FSA do not mind wonder who at the FSA agreed this  and for what reason makes you think?
Margo Sheridan,    21 March 2014,Last September my car was parked outside my house when another car drove into it causing so much damage that my car was written off. Unfortunate you may think  but the real nightmare was making a claim with Aviva. Seven months later this  claim is not resolved. Aviva have been  breathtakingly incompetent -constantly losing paperwork  disposing of my car without my knowledge or consent etc. I made a formal complaint which is now escalated to the Financial Ombudsman. &#9;Trouble is  Aviva deny responsibility and constantly try to pass the buck on the complaint to its subcontractors. By far the worst car insurance I&#39;ve ever had
manerva1,    08 February 2014,If you believe you are insured with Aviva then think again. They used every excuse not to replace my mobile iphone 4. They tried to insinuate that the IMEl number was incorrect despite me verifying my lost iphone IMEI number with the phone operator. Despite my previously damaged phone being replaced by them originally.... !!!! They try to suggest that you are a liar. Happy to take your money! Unhappy to payout. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I made a formal complaint to them. Im even tempted to upload my imei proof from my mobile phone provider... Aviva response... and also proof that the insurance company replaced thus said mentkoned phone to expose them further.  I will update you guys.
Joanna Barrow,    07 January 2014,I bought a car way before my driving test because as most other teens I was an over excited 18 year old girl who worked every hour possible to afford driving lessons and a car. I knew the insurance would be steep  but most quotes I got were around £3 000 a year  FAR TOO MUCH as my car (an 02 fiat punto) only cost me £800.I rang up Aviva&#39;s side insurance company MYPOLICY.com which is a company that fits a box to reduce the cost. They originally quoted me £3 500 but after hours on the phone crying and complaining I got the insurance down to £2 300. Again very expensive but the lowest I could get. so I bought it.One month later I decide to move from Manchester to Scotland  they told me I couldn&#39;t take my car because of the box that has been fitted. I wasn&#39;t willing to pay £2 300 a year for my car to be sat in Manchester collecting dust. I asked my mum to sort out cancelling it for me because they just walked over me and were rude. I had only had the car a month and when we cancelled it they charged us £100 to remove the box  £100 cancelation fee and only gave us back £1 300 of our money. I had only had the insurance for a month and it cost me £1 000!!!! outrageous!I&#39;m also still waiting for them to come and remove the box out my car which I paid £100 for them to do!!This has been an expensive experience for me! luckily I found a better policy in Scotland that costs half of what these were charging and WITHOUT a box!Boxes are not worth getting!On a more positive note they did only have one good thing I can say about them  I was driving once and accidentally drove at the wrong speed which gave me a warning with the box. The man who rang me up to tell me this was very polite and rather funny too! he talked me through what I had done wrong and how I can improve for the future. Again I recommend not getting a box with MYpolicy.com
Pip Knowles,    22 November 2013,after someone damaged the back of my car i called aviva who booked the car in and delivered a courtesy straight away from their own repair company who kept me informed every step of the the way.  repair was 100% and they even did a professional valet on the car.well done
Jud Sam,    03 October 2013,as always with insurance  you only find out how bad they are when you need to make a claim. Ive been round the houses for the last 4 months and now just feel helpless  they are not int he least bit helpful. Wouldnt use again.
Miranda Smythe,    22 August 2013,The company wrongly removed my no claims discount and after I re-proved it they reinstated it.  This took weeks to sort out and I was assured that everything was fine.TODAY I received a letter from them saying that my car insurance ran out a month ago.Basically they had cancelled my car insurance and I have been driving around totally uninsured for the last 6 weeks.  They didn&#39;t seem to get why I was upset by this and said that they had &#39;tried to telephone me twice&#39;.  The fact that I could have been prosecuted  or be £40 000 out of pocket for an uninsured Range Rover did not register at all.My advice would be stay well clear. They are in absolute chaos and are appalling to deal with.  Shame I had to give one star.
Julie Shaw,    30 May 2013,this is probably the best insurance company I have dealt with up to yet  they just assist as much as they can and Paul  helped with reducing the cost by taking out things I did not need from my cover to reduce the premium.Thanks
Sylvia Freeman,    16 May 2013,Had a life insurance and paid for nearly the full length of many years  had closed my bank account and had to set up new debit with new bank so phoned in my payment early but they still took it as did not have the sense to inform the accounts department it had been paid and instantly refund it. Denied any need to refund my overdraft fees when they still took it from the account being closed. Then refused to refund fees and also did not even refund the payment until a massive arguement on the phone. On their site they state&quot; if a mistake by MY BANK or themselves they would immediately refund!!! How can they refuse to sort it out. Absolutely no empathy just interested in the money. They were the most expensive insurance I have had and after man thousands of pounds from me in payments could not even refund a few pounds of fees!! Have cancelled and will make sure all my family who are in very high positions in industry having contact with many users who require insurances will ensure they do not sign up with Aviva  also my son in Uni who is active on student union and a member of a political party so plenty of contact with a huge amount of people. plenty of other cheaper companies with better customer service. A personal advisor who nearly lost me a lot of money referred me to them so no doubt she got a good fee and not interested also in my best interest. Will never ever use them again and can see why they are going down the pan.  So many lovely companies around who genuinely want to help and have good customer service.  Now received 2 letters ensuring they try to make sure they are not accountable but how can they argue with the fact on their paperwork they say they will refund money immediately!!!  Search around that is what I suggest.
Keith Simpson,    13 May 2013,Do not use this company my 75 year old mother is trying to pay them back early and she can not unless she pays them a £11000.00 interest plus a £ 200.00 charge so do not use them for anything they have already made £ 1000s in interest from herI used them for car insurance and they can&#39;t be bothered to return your call so no matter wot they offer don&#39;t use them
alastair dick,    11 May 2013,I took out car insurance with aviva only to have it doubled when they dis-allowed my NCD..I made various enquiries including having a broker &#39;phone them who received a quote hundreds of pounds less.As the representative who took my cancellation stated my case had not been handled well.Adding insult to injury Aviva sent me a demand for 63 pence which i had paid on cancellation.Aviva is not a company I will ever deal with again.
Zoe Elizabeth Blayney,    04 April 2013,My car was stolen from a public car park (7 weeks after purchasing the car!!) and Aviva were fast and efficient with dealing with my claim. As it was the first time I have ever had to claim anything  I was stressed about the whole situation and had sleepless nights. One particular lady at Aviva  Ms Daly  was VERY helpful and put my mind at ease almost instantly. She didnt go on to speak in high technical terms (which I would very unlikely not understand)  she made it easy for me to understand what was happening and what the process is. I couldn&#39;t appreicate her help enough. I am to give them a call when I get a new car and they will simply change my car details over. I am so thankful to Ms Daly and Aviva for all their help with my claim. I couldtn possibly fault them!!
Nick Cox,    27 December 2012,I&#39;ve had a pension policy on which my bank account is debited on a monthly basis.This has been going since the 1980&#39;s and was originally under the name of Norwich Union.Since August I have been trying to get details of what the policy is worth but have had no reply.Nothing! Yet it is quite a substantial amount of money I now have invested in this policy.Their incompetence makes me worried if they have been investing my monthly debits in my policy at all.Back in 2010 they wrote to me saying the policy would have to be made paid-up as I had not been making my monthly debits.I was able to prove they were wrong by showing them my bank statements showing the standing order  in place since 1988.They are incompetent and I think dishonourable that they do not even reply to customers from whom they have been taking substantial sums of money for 25 years.I would advise anyone and everyone not to trust them with a penny of their money.

Mark Hough,    06 October 2012,Appear very competitive  with the 15 weeks free insurance - the premiums about half of what I was paying for the same level of cover. Not claimed yet (hopefully  won&#39;t have to) - so can&#39;t comment on that side of things.
David Emmerson,    22 June 2012,For a start  they are expensive  and don&#39;t put themselves on the comparison websites. However  a bigger problem for me was that through one of the companies under their insurance umbrella  they carry out credit checks when you ask for a quote through GoCompare.This is just for a quote.Against the credit record with Call Credit (Noddle)  I had numerous entries from them  all labelled as &#39;Credit&#39; checks.There&#39;s a failure of both them and Call Credit to recognise that this is a problem. Another company looking at the record will see these entries and will think credit has been applied for  when it never has.Noddle have even had to specifically name Aviva in their description of the complaint category that fits this  saying that because people have ticked the box allowing credit checks then they are allowed to do them in this case. I made the argument against  and eventually (although not admitting fault) they have said they will get them removed.
Vicky Heart,    12 April 2012,Good insurance and investment deals. This company offers guarantees which will protect a defined level of your original investment on its fifth anniversary.
j cobb,    08 March 2012,Was quoted £840 for 2 car policy  mine was £650 of this with 1 years NCD. Aviva wouldn&#39;t accept proof of this as was with Admiral on joint policy. This increased premium to £1694 total. They took £854 from our account without a letter or phone call or email. When I phoned to query and asked what % 1 years NCD was the customer service person didn&#39;t know then came back with 50%. Surely this would just double the premium on my car but was told new premium was correct. Will be going elsewhere for both cars and did a new online quote with Aviva(bearing in mind we were new customers in November) to check which was £825 with no NCD for me. Makes no sense at all.
