Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive

Taking Lyrica for nerve pain. 150 mg. X2. Hair falling out and I have a bald spot in the back of my head.,neutral
great for pain of fibromyagia and osteoartritis but it makes me so hungry like the munchies used to do when smoking pot.,positive
